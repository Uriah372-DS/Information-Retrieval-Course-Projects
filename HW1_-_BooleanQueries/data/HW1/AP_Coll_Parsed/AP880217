kevin bacon and elizabeth mcgovern didnt mind 
playing two squares in the comedy hymn to marital fidelity shes 
having a baby in fact they liked the movies emphasis on 
oldstyle morals 
oldfashioned is newfashioned lets face it bacon said 
directorwriter john hughes is basically an oldvalues type of 
guy in all his movies mcgovern said and his story of a young 
couple jake and kristy briggs is a tribute to suburbia and to 
the virtue of commitment 
though the actors are young bacon is 29 mcgovern is 26 both 
are examples of another oldfashioned virtue hard work they 
recently talked about just how hard it was to bring out baby 
one scene the briggs wedding was shot over 26 consecutive 
hours it was filmed in the winnetka congregational church in 
illinois which was available for only a limited time 
two versions of the scene were filmed a straightforward 
account of the wedding and jakes hallucination about what his 
wedding vows really mean 
wilt thou listen to endless conversations about childrens 
clothes and decorator checkbooks the minister asks in the 
fantasy version 
the marathon session demanded a lot of bacon i actually fell 
asleep on my feet he said 
bacon who previously appeared in diner and footloose 
is on the screen in almost every frame of the film in one scene 
jake sits outside the church with his best man who tries to tempt 
him not to get married 
the struggle bacon says was to win the audiences sympathy 
despite the fact that his character is on the brink of jilting the 
beautiful kristy 
i really wanted him to seem like a little boy in a monkey 
suit and that was difficult bacon said 
mcgoverns travails were more subtle her character kristy 
appears bland but shes not said the actress 
kristy is very strong although she doesnt necessarily appear 
on the surface to be strong said mcgovern who first drew 
attention in the industry with her portrayal of timothy huttons 
girlfriend in 1980 in the academy awardwinning ordinary 
people the next year she had a supporting actress oscar 
nomination for her role in ragtime 
shes a person you wouldnt ever think twice about mcgovern 
said but before the end of the movie the door opens on her soul 
and you see how much there is she has to offer 
both actors lauded hughes direction as strong and 
independent as i come off on the set i need a director who will 
say ok thats good you got it bacon said hughes did that 
for him 
mcgovern agreed i always felt supported and i always knew 
that he would guide me 
by the end of the filming hughes trusted bacon to improvise 
one touching and funny result has jake trying natural childbirth 
methods massaging his abdomen and panting while kristy gives 
birth in another room 
by that point id been playing this character so many times 
and in so many different situations that i really felt that i knew 
him and john knew him and he just kind of said well turn 
the camera on and you just hang out in the room and do what you 
would do 
the tension bacon has felt in front of the camera in other 
movies didnt apply in this one he said john sort of blows all 
that tension right out of the water by letting the camera roll 
during retakes instead of shouting action or cut a lot 
the atmosphere during filming was relaxed enough for bacon to 
bring along his dog jane whom he calls a labrador deceiver 
a mutt thats part lab 
bacon and mcgovern are both accomplished on the new york stage 
and are used to feeding on the energy of an audience but in a way 
mcgovern said the director filled that function 
when he was looking at me he would see kristy he wouldnt see 
elizabeth she said

the letters phone calls and telegrams come 
from across the nation but the message to police and state parole 
board members is almost always the same thomas trantino must not 
go free 
nearly 25 years after trantino and an accomplice shot sgt peter 
voto and officer gary tedesco to death at pointblank range in a 
nightclub here emotions still run high 
from an accountant in nearby teaneck the courts and the 
parole system should start to recognize the danger which these 
criminals present to society if he killed in cold blood two police 
officers who were in uniform how can those of us who are citizens 
in plain clothes be safe 
from a connecticut woman i dont want to hear that he is a 
model prisoner who is now a writer a painter they are 
forgetting he has one other glaring accomplishment and that is 
that he committed a coldblooded murder of two human beings 
the prospect of release has sparked a petition drive 
legislative proposals a letterwriting campaign and a candlelight 
rally by more than 1500 people to convince the parole board that 
trantino must remain behind bars 
the case has also revived debate over an old question when has 
a murderer finally paid his debt to society 
paramus police chief joseph delaney a leader of the campaign 
against parole said many feel the people who commit the violent 
acts arent getting punishment that fits the crime 
they want to see pure unadulterated punishment he added 
dont say life in prison for someone and then let him out 15 
20 or 25 years later 
on aug 26 1963 trantino and frank falco were at the angel 
lounge celebrating a robbery when voto and tedesco arrived to 
investigate a disturbance trantino and falco surprised them 
partially stripped them and shot them 
falco was killed the next day by police trying to capture him 
trantino was caught convicted and sentenced to die in the electric 
chair 
the sentence was commuted to life when new jerseys death 
penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972 in 1980 the full 
parole board voted to release trantino provided that he make 
restitution to the families of his victims 
the decision sparked an outcry and in 1982 the board voted to 
keep trantino locked up for 10 more years a term that was cut 
almost in half through credits for good behavior and work 
a twomember panel decided last month that he should be paroled 
march 15 but the full board has decided to review the decision 
a parole board official citing policy declined to explain the 
decision however under state law trantino can be paroled only if 
he shows no substantial likelihood of future criminal activity 
and proves he has made progression in rehabilitating himself 
from 1978 to 1982 trantino was granted regular furloughs from 
prison which ended after the controversy over his parole in 1980 
he married the community college english professor who had edited 
his prison writings into a book 
trantino 50 is now at the mediumsecurity riverfront state 
prison in camden and declined an interview request in a 1986 
interview he said he had no recollection of the murders and 
believed his freedom was long overdue 
he works in the prison canteen storeroom and participates in a 
program that tries to convince juvenile delinquents in a low 
key way to change their ways said department of corrections 
spokesman james stabile 
victims rights organizations delaney and votos brother 
andrew now police chief in this small bluecollar community have 
been at the forefront of efforts to block parole 
recently delaney and voto appeared on morton downey jrs 
television talk show the next day about 1000 people called the 
board from across the country to oppose trantinos release 
hes a classic con artist delaney said i have dealt with 
people in my many years as a cop and theres no question in my mind 
that if they release him he will kill again 
the case has struck a chord among family members of crime 
victims 
most of the letters that come in to me thank me for picking up 
the fight against coddling prisoners theres too much concern for 
these people voto said 
why should a man walk out when he was sentenced to death 
there is rehabilitation and i am for it but not in these types of 
cases not an outright killer a coldblooded killer

former television evangelist pat robertson 
took in stride his bottomofthepile finish in the new hampshire 
primary tuesday saying he was ready to shine in the south in my 
backyard 
with returns nearly complete in the republican primary 
robertson was last among the five contenders 
we played in bob doles backyard in iowa and i beat george 
bush there robertson said we played in new hampshire which 
according to george bush is his backyard and he won convincingly 
tomorrow morning i go into the south and theyre going to be 
playing in my backyard robertson said in a concession speech at 
a hotel ballroom as several hundred supporters cheered stomped and 
chanted we want pat 
robertson 57 with his wife dede at his side said 
im throwing the gauntlet down to bob dole and george bush 
south carolina is the first super tuesday state and im going to 
beat you there convincingly 
south carolina republicans actually vote the saturday before 
super tuesday when 20 states hold caucuses or primaries 
the crowd cheered again when one supporter yelled out youve 
got the biggest backyard pat 
earlier robertsons national field director richard pinsky 
acknowledged that after robertsons surprise secondplace showing 
in the feb 8 iowa caucuses we were hoping to do better here 
robertson said in an interview on nbctv our polling showed 
we would have a strong third place we came up very short on that 
pinsky blamed robertsons showing on two controversies in the 
past week kemps charges about allegations made by a group from 
which robertson distanced himself and robertsons claim during a 
gop debate sunday that the soviet union has nukes in cuba 
robertson was hounded monday by questions on his statement 
during the debate and subsequently said his was not a 
categorical statement per se 
but in his concession remarks robertson said he will meet with 
cuban leaders in florida this week and it may be that something 
happened in the debate here which may be the key to victory in 
florida 
later he said weve got an issue that came out of here on the 
cuban missiles i wasnt expecting it to play this way but im 
getting reports from texas and florida that the people down there 
are with me on this issue so new hampshire may have given me the 
key issue to win the two biggest states in the south

it was once known as the black country 
because of its long winters harsh terrain and hard life even at 
the dawn of this century it still was a land of barbarian tribes 
and powerful feudal warriors one of japans last frontiers 
warrior clans and impoverished peasants lived in isolation among 
its vast mountain ranges 
but it had a bucolic tranquility and japanese poured in from all 
over to enjoy what japan once was volcanic hot springs and rugged 
seascapes folk crafts and villages old temples and teahouses 
welltended apple orchards and rice fields 
this is tohoku the black countrys formal name and it takes up 
the entire northern end of honshu japans main island 
but tohokus leaders are planning to catapult tohoku into the 
21st century turning the region into a hub of technological 
progress filled with hightech factories seaports and 
telecommunications centers 
if that happens some fear tohokus culture and way of life 
will vanish 
some of it already has 
new highways and highspeed train lines have brought modern 
japan closer to tohoku thousands upon thousands come to its ski 
resorts and lakes snowscapes and primieval marshes in three 
national parks all offering a respite from the urban plain around 
tokyo a little over 100 miles to the south 
sendai is now tohokus largest city with 700000 residents 
devastated by world war ii bombing its broad treelined boulevards 
are a rare product of postwar city planning 
between tohokus growing cities lie vast wooded mountains and 
cultivated plains where people carry on a simpler more 
traditional japanese lifestyle 
most live in houses that are huge by comparison with those in 
tokyo but they lack central heating and flush toilets peoples 
lives are suited to the seasons the cold winter months are spend 
clustered around quiltcovered heaters called kotatsu and 
observing the traditional festivals and rituals tied to the 
planting and harvesting of rice 
but in sendai the tohoku federation of economic organizations 
a powerful business alliance is planning a leap into the 21st 
century 
if the federation has its way rustic northern japan will become 
a network of technolopolises marinopolises teletopias and a 
magmapolis modern cities based on high technology seaports 
telecommunications and power generation and tourism tied to 
volcanic activity 
prime minister noboru takeshitas furusato hometown 
concept a plan to establish centers of industry and culture in 
rural japan is further encouragement for tohokus planners 
more than 34 foreign firms and some of japans leading 
electronics companies already have moved their factories from tokyo 
to industrial parks in tohoku attracted by tax incentives lower 
land costs and abundant water and energy 
real estate cost an average 9 a square foot in tohoku in 1987 
compared with 11050 in suburban tokyo 
several company presidents said fresh skilled labor drew their 
firms to tohoku where the people are known for their serious 
character and diligence 
federation officials maintain that hightech industrial 
development poses little threat to the tohokus environment 
but opponents claim the air already has become polluted around 
heavily used roads and that even clean semiconductor factories 
must use dangerous chemicals 
about onetenth of japans 121 million people the same number 
that live in tokyo live in all of tohoku which makes up 20 
percent of japans land area 
toshio tamakawa chairman of the tohoku federation and president 
of the regions largest corporation tohoku electric power says 
tohoku is an attractive alternative to tokyos congestion and high 
prices 
people used to say tohoku was a barbarian hinterland he 
said they certainly cant say that anymore 
nearby matsushima pine island is still considered one of the 
most beautiful spots in japan but the pacific coast to north and 
south is a mass of grey factories and shipyards 
modernization has brought flashy department stores and hotels to 
sendai along with subways urban sprawl and traffic jams 
but even in quieter less developed areas life is changing 
a few hours north of sendai in hiraizumi taxi driver kirio 
aoyanagi in blue uniform and white gloves talks of how he 
returned to his native town from miserably lonely tokyo after 
living there almost 10 years to marry and raise his family 
aoyanagi now guides tourists through ancient temples and 
describes the floods wars and fires that destroyed most of 
hiraizumi a city built around 1100 by the powerful fujiwara clan 
that was once a center of political power 
aoyanagi says he and others cant live by farming alone and 
need factory jobs but he worries that old traditions are 
disappearing as tohoku grows more modern and less isolated 
its not like it used to be he said people are becoming 
selfcentered just like in tokyo the younger generation is 
completely different 
a giant buddhas face loomed out of a nearby cliff in a quiet 
mountain valley below a group of farmers in traditional aprons 
and kerchiefs worked at rethatching a farmhouse roof a picture 
of the past 
i want to keep tohoku a good place to live aoyanagi said 
where people care about each other and not just their money

hospitals in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip are overcrowded and increasingly 
overwhelmed with victims of israels policy of using beatings and 
blows to subdue arab protesters 
last wednesday at the gaza strips largest shifa hospital 
palestinian doctors set the broken limbs of 24 arabs clubbed by 
israeli soldiers then swiftly discharged them to make room for 
more 
in the west banks nablus on friday troops fired rubber bullets 
and smashed windows with their rifle butts to break into al ittihad 
hospital and detain four arabs suspected of throwing stones 
a wall was smeared with blood where docors said the arabs were 
beaten and six windows were broken one punctured with a rubber 
bullet 
besides treating scores of victims palestinian hospitals have 
served as havens for arab protesters trying to elude detention 
after antiisraeli demonstrations 
shifa hospital has been a staging ground for riots by hundreds 
of palestinians who hurled firebombs and stones at soldiers troops 
stormed the hospital twice within two days in december and shot 
dead two arabs 
this is a situation worse than on the tv serial mash 
said dr h jack geiger a member of a factfinding team from the 
bostonbased physicians for human rights that visited hospitals in 
the territories 
people are stitching wounds without gloves and without 
anesthesia these hospitals are completely inadequate for the 
treatment of this kind of trauma and do not meet an acceptable 
standard geiger said last wednesday 
as geiger spoke at shifa a large gingercolored cat wandered 
through wards that reeked with the smell of urine and feces thick 
fetid water filled cloggedup toilets and sinks in the bathroom and 
a pool of open sewage ran on the floor 
at alia hospital in hebron last week an associated press 
reporter watched doctors stitch up the wounds of palestinian 
patients lying on bloodstained stretchers on the emergency room 
floor because all the beds were filled 
a doctor stitched shut a deep gash on the head of a 20yearold 
man shaking with pain while in a stretcher beside him another 
doctor set a mans broken forearm 
we work with the minimal medical standards said dr ahmed 
yassih of shifa which like hebrons alia hospital is israelirun 
every time we operate there is a shortage 
one day there was no clean linen another day no water then 
no towels no sterile instruments sometimes we work without 
electricity or have no silk thread for stitches said yassih one 
of four palestinian surgeons who perform most operations at shifa 
yassih said he discharged 45 palestinians with beating injuries 
including 24 with broken limbs after only a few hours of treatment 
last wednesday 
there just arent enough beds yassih said we get more 
and more cases every day i have to keep at least 15 beds free for 
emergencies 
lying in rows of narrow metal frame beds were dozens of 
palestinians recovering from more serious beating injuries and 
gunshot wounds 
one 17yearold palestinian student jihad al achronz of rafah 
was paralyzed from the waist down from a bullet wound that 
punctured a spinal nerve 
another 14yearold ahmed al khalud of jabaliya refugee camp 
suffered epileptic seizures incontinence and paralysis of his 
lower spine and upper leg from a bullet wound to the back 
youssef hamad 40 screamed as doctors lifted him to examine a 
swollen black bruise from his neck to lower back both hamads arms 
and legs were in casts his bandaged head had 12 deep gashes and 
several ribs were fractured 
hamad said he was beaten by 10 soldiers who accused him of 
raising the outlawed palestinian flag on a gaza city street 
yasih said beating victims often were from the same family or 
section of a refugee camp and frequently were clubbed at night he 
said he treated 12 members of the al masri family from gaza six of 
whom had broken limbs 
we find people injured in the same places over and over the 
upper chest legs back knees arms hands and elbows yassih 
said he said about half the victims treated at shifa had broken 
legs and 60 percent had broken hands 
yassih also said many palestinians were reluctant to go to shifa 
or other israelirun hospitals because hospital officials are 
required to give patients names to the army which patrols outside 
the hospital gate 
three days earlier troops entered the hospital and took three 
arab patients from their beds reinforcing palestinians fears the 
doctor said

abc only got a silver in the ratings the first 
week of winter olympics coverage but abcs world news tonight 
was golden for the first time since august snapping cbs 20week 
win streak 
the first two nights of the olympics saturday and sunday 
varied widely in the ac nielsen co ratings but according to abc 
averaged higher than the first two nights of the 1984 games 
an estimated 25 million viewers saw sunday nights coverage 
featuring pairs figure skating putting it in the top 10 with a 
197 rating and a 30 share but saturdays coverage of hockey was 
in the bottom 10 with a 99 rating and 17 share 
the rating is a percentage of the 886 million households with 
televisions the share is a percentage of sets in use that are

the 130 palestinian deportees whose voyage 
home was aborted by the bombing of their ship this week include 
prominent arab proponents of peace with israel as well as others 
who advocate violence 
most were expelled from their israelioccupied homeland without 
trial under a process considered illegal by virtually every nation 
except israel 
the palestine liberation organization gathered the deportees and 
hundreds of observers in athens for a trip back to israel aboard a 
ship of return 
their goal was to focus attention on israels policy of exiling 
palestinians from the west bank and gaza strip which israel seized 
in the 1967 middle east war 
participants said the voyage would have been probably the 
largest nonviolent action attempted by the plo 
we have chosen to go back with no guns no explosives not 
even any stones said mohammed milhem deported mayor of the west 
bank city of halhoul 
israeli leaders had vowed to block the ship from reaching 
israels shores 
on monday before the deportees could fly from athens to the 
port of limassol cyprus to begin the protest voyage an explosion 
left a hole below the waterline of the ferry bought for the trip a 
day before three plo guerrillas were killed in a car bombing also 
in limassol 
the plo accused israel of responsibility 
the planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the ship 
exodus in which jewish refugees from nazi death camps were turned 
back by british forces as they tried to reach palestine 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir had called the 
plosponsored trip a declaration of war on israel and branded 
participants as terrorists and those who want to kill us every 
one of us 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said in 1985 that deportations 
were effective for those who instigate and call for participation 
in terror even though they themselves are not active 
the same 1945 british mandate laws used by israel for many of 
the deportations were applied against shamir and other israeli 
leaders who led guerrilla bands that assassinated and bombed 
british soldiers and arabs in the 1940s 
the un security council denounced the deportations in 1980 and 
again last month saying they contravened the 1949 geneva 
convention 
their goal is to leave our people leaderless said 
abduljawad saleh exiled in 1973 a year after his reelection as 
mayor of albireh 
among those listed for the trip are the president of bir zeit 
university the president of the jerusalem higher islamic council 
the jordanian mayor of jerusalem the deputy mayor of jenin and the 
assistant anglican archbishop of jerusalem 
milhem expelled in 1980 and elected to the plo executive 
committee in 1984 often has been suggested as a moderate 
palestinian negotiator for middle east peace talks 
saleh described himself as a nonviolent activist and said 
he was never told specifically what triggered his deportation 
he recalled that israeli military officials had summoned him to 
warn against founding agricultural cooperatives and ordered him to 
stop protesting on behalf of villagers outside albireh 
like milhem and many other exiles saleh said he favors 
acceptance of israel alongside a palestinian state two states to 
live in peace together in the same country was the way anglican 
bishop eliya khoury put it 
not all deportees agree with that view 
four palestinians expelled last month issued a statement shortly 
after arriving in lebanon saying islamic radicals there should 
threaten to execute three israeli hostages if israel kept up 
its crackdown on palestinians in the occupied lands more than 50 
palestinians have been killed in rioting in the west bank and gaza 
strip since dec 8 most of them by israeli gunfire 
according to palestinian and jordanian officials israel has 
deported up to 3000 palestinians 
many deportees say they want peace with israelis but within an 
arabdominated palestinian state 
my brother and my grandfather and his father and my children 
were born in palestine said nashaat labadeh a nablus school 
principal this is our land palestine belongs to us 
he said he was deported largely for his involvement in a 1968 
teachers strike against israels attempt to impose its school 
books on west bank pupils 
saleh said israel should not close its doors to those who have 
attacked it in the past 
even if we were terrorists and we are demanding a peaceful 
solution i think we are the people to make peace with he said 
you dont make peace with your friends you make peace with 
your enemies

a city official says transit agency employees are 
suspected sabotaging safety devices on train doors 
this appears to be an insider problem someone who obviously 
knows enough about cars to disable them said frank wilson the 
chicago transit authoritys senior deputy executive director in 
charge of maintenance 
inspectors at a rail yard discovered the vandalism involving 
the airfilled rubber edges that prevent doors from closing on 
passengers wilson said 
over the weekend 25 doors on 18 cars were vandalized he said 
air hoses either were disconnected or cut cleanly where they 
connect to a compressor wilson said monday 
on tuesday crews found 11 new cases of apparent tampering 
including five instances of damage to cars that had been repaired 
since the weekend he said 
there were no passenger injuries linked to the faulty doors 
wilson has been very outspoken about the agencys problems since 
coming to chicago a month ago from a similar post in philadelphia 
last fall the transit authority suspected employee sabotage 
when fuses necessary for emergency brake systems were missing in 
100 cars an investigation failed to produce any suspects

george bush got the win he so badly needed 
in new hampshires republican presidential primary tuesday and 
proclaimed reports of my death are greatly exaggerated bob 
dole fumed over what he called campaign distortions and told bush 
quit lying about my record 
thank you new hampshire bush said apt words of gratitude 
to the state that revived his presidential hopes on to the 
south where were going to rise again 
dole accused bushs campaign of distorting his record in a 
flurry of late television commercials aired in new hampshire the 
kansas senator said the ads unfairly accused him of backing an oil 
import fee and trying to raise taxes after complaining for much of 
the evening he was asked if he had anything to say to bush during 
a live interview with both men on nbctv 
yeah quit lying about my record dole said im not for 
raising anybodys taxes and he knows that im not advocating a 10 
oil import fee and he knows that but they were on the ads all 
weekend 
dole also said he regretted not answering bush more forcefully 
during the waning days of the new hampshire campaign saying he had 
been too kind 
bush led with 38 percent to doles 29 percent with all 
precincts reporting 
the remaining three gop candidates lagged far behind new york 
rep jack kemp at 13 percent former delaware gov pete du pont at 
10 percent and former television evangelist pat robertson at 10 
percent 
a sixth candidate alexander haig dropped out of the race 
friday and registered less than 1 percent 
kemp claimed he was in third place and sought to make that sound 
like a victory we won the contest for the conservative wing and 
now were going to contest fo the whole nomination of the 
republican party kemp said 
robertson looked ahead to primaries in the south saying he had 
competed in doles backyard of iowa and bushs in new hampshire 
tomorrow morning we go into the south and theyre going to be 
playing in my backyard robertson said 
he pointed to south carolina which holds a gop primary three 
days before the rest of the south votes on super tuesday march 8 
im going to beat you there convincingly he said to his rivals 
du pont also contended he was in the running with kemp and 
robertson for third place he called it a virtual tie among 
those three and said thats got to be good 
dole said its better to win and i congratulate the winner 
i can stand here with my head held high 
dole said bush had distorted his record by accusing him of 
backing tax increases dole who was battling a reputation as a 
slashing campaigner earned in his 1976 vice presidential race 
suggested he may come back at bush as the campaign turns to the 
south in the coming three weeks 
i think we should have answered the charges i mean i think 
you can be too kind to your opponent and we were dole said 
they kept saying bob dole wants to raise taxes they know that 
was not accurate we wanted to keep it positive and see if it 
worked 
its unfortunate that the vice president of the united states 
who knows better would sink to that level dole said 
asked later about doles accusing remark bush said i dont 
know what hes talking about but bushs campaign in washington 
issued a statement quoting bush four times over the last six months 
saying he would support the oil tax 
dole has said he would consider the oil import fee but would 
rebate the fee to homeowners who use oil for heat 
bushs victory came after his oncestrong advantage in the polls 
had evaporated following his dismal showing in iowa a week ago 
dole forces pointed to that comeback even as it fell short 
we were down more than 20 points eight days ago said dole 
campaign manager william brock to have come this close is a 
tremendous commentary on bob dole and also on the softness of 
the vice presidents supporters 
if he is going to have this kind of a problem in the south 
hes got a real problem brock said 
earlier in the day bush said things have dramatically turned 
around for him in new hampshire just as they did for ronald 
reagan in 1980 
bush pointed cheerfully to the traditional first returns that 
were counted just after midnight in tiny dixville notch in the 
states northern mountains there he was a winner with 11 votes to 
doles 6 
bushs oncesubstantial lead in polls in the state evaporated 
following doles twotoone victory over him in iowas caucuses a 
week earlier but daily polling by the television networks 
indicated the trend to dole tailed off by the weekend and the race 
stabilized into a virtual dead heat 
bush also found comfort in new hampshires history of rejecting 
iowa winners including himself in 1980 
he did what i did in 1980 bush said of dole he won in 
iowa and came in and talked about momentum i did what presidnt 
reagan did he came in and started talking the issues after 
losing to bush in iowa 
bush searched urgently following his iowa debacle for a way to 
better deliver his message that he is the logical heir to 
reagans conservative legacy 
he was an insulated candidate who rarely made contact with 
reporters in iowa a time when he was beset with questions over his 
role in sales of us missiles to iran but with his politial 
future on the line after the iowa defeat bush began asking for 
votes with apparent emotion and uncharacteristically climbed into 
the cab of a big truck and drove a forklift to try to display a 
common mans touch

massachusetts gov michael dukakis claimed 
a great victory in the new hampshire presidential primary 
tuesday moving to the front of the democratic field with the 
backing of his neighbors 
rep richard gephardt of missouri the winner last week in the 
iowa caucuses held onto the no 2 spot besting sen paul simon 
of illinois for the second time in a row 
its really a great victory in many ways dukakis said 
because these are the people who know me best and they had to 
test me not as neighbor but as a presidential candidate 
its just a terrific boost obviously its going to be very 
important as we go into the south and the middle west he said 
but the massachusetts governor would not claim the 
frontrunners crown im wary of that label 
with all precincts reporting dukakis had 36 percent gephardt 
20 percent and simon 17 percent 
further back were jesse jackson at 8 percent sen albert gore 
jr of tennessee at 7 percent former arizona gov bruce babbitt at 
5 percent and former sen gary hart of colorado at 4 percent 
gephardt said he did well across the state exaggerating his 
showing a bit by claiming the only thing we didnt carry was the 
boston suburbs 
about a week ago they said we couldnt compete in new 
hampshire gephardt said now he declared it appears that 
weve got a dukakisgephardt race in the rest of the country but 
that could change 
and the missouri congressman said money is not a problem 
were raising money at a good clip he said we are going 
to be fine for super tuesday 
that was not the case for simon whose campaign was alrady 
500000 in debt before the primary 
this is not helping simon said from the financial point 
of view if i were 3 percentage points ahead instead of 3 points 
behind it would make a huge difference in collecting money 
babbitt was nexttolast and hart last but both refused to end 
their campaigns 
this nomination is not won in one week or 30 days its going 
to be a sixmonth campaign said hart who won new hampshire in 
1984 
hart who reentered the race saying let the voters decide 
admitted he would have to start doing better it will take at 
least 30 to 60 days to determine whether or not i can put together 
a viable candidacy 
asked if he was going to withdraw babbitt said no way im 
going to move on to washington in a couple of days and call and 
talk to my supporters all over the country and ask them this 
question how can we keep this reform movement alive should i 
wage a guerilla campaign or should i withdraw or do something else 
 
jackson said he was satisfied with his showing here our 
message has won they outspent me 10to1 and yet a poor 
campaign a rich message has been successful in new hampshire he 
said 
gore said he did better than anticipated in new hampshire and 
had no regrets about doing little campaigning there 
we made a decision not to spent a million dollars on two or 
three delegates were saving that for the 1400 delegates here in 
the super tuesday states gore said in houston he was the only 
candidate who wasnt in new hampshire tuesday night 
simon and gephardt had been concentrating their fire on each 
other until the final weekend when both switched to ads attacking 
dukakis 
i havent been watching a lot of television lately but im 
told people have been saying some pretty nasty things about me 
dukakis said i assume thats going to take its toll 
dukakis was angered at simons ad which suggested he is a 
technocrat who doesnt care about people simon obviously does 
not know what hes talking about dukakis said

leaving the snows of new hampshire behind the 
presidential candidates set their sights today on the next big test 
the south with its highstakes super tuesday contests looming 
three weeks away 
on to the south where were going to rise again said vice 
president george bush fresh from his revival in new hampshire 
republican rival bob dole threatened to shatter what his 
campaign called a myth of invincibility surrounding the vice 
presidents organization in the south 
the change in scenery couldnt come too soon for pat robertson 
after his lastplace finish in new hampshire robertson a 
virginian consoled his followers by saying tomorrow morning we 
go into the south and theyre going to be playing in my backyard 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis coming off a strong 
firstplace finish in his neighboring state was conceding nothing 
to democratic rivals albert gore jr a tennessean who is banking 
on his native dixie and jesse jackson who has a strong base in 
the regions large black population 
some people have been asking how a new englander can hope to 
do well on super tuesday dukakis said the fact of the matter 
is i dont have a southern strategy i dont have a northern 
strategy i have an american strategy 
gore in houston was the only one of the candidates not in new 
hampshire tuesday night we made a decision not to spend a 
million dollars on two or three delegates he told supporters 
after new hampshire several candidates were heading to south 
dakota minnesota and wyoming where lowerstakes contests are 
scheduled between now and march 8 but the big attentiongrabber is 
super tuesday march 8 when 20 states most of them in the south 
stage primaries or caucuses 
the delegate prize 1307 democrats or more than half of the 
2082 needed to win the nomination and 700 republicans also more 
than of the 1139 needed to nominate 
gore has a favorite line about his decision to bypass iowa and 
run a limited campaign in new hampshire if youre going to go 
duck hunting you go where the ducks are if youre hunting for 
delegates you go where the delegates are 
super tuesday in a sense is gores first stand and without a 
strong showing it could be his last 
we must do well on super tuesday theres no ifs ands or 
buts about it said his campaign manager fred martin 
jackson who has solid black backing has taken the lead in some 
recent southern surveys in iowa and new hampshire both of which 
have only tiny black populations jackson notched respectable 
fourthplace showings indicating he has broadened his base of 
support 
gore has singled out jackson as his main opponent in the south 
i think it will essentially become a twoperson race he said 
he raised the electability of jackson on tuesday saying 
democrats in all parts of the country are really hungry for a 
victory in 1988 and interested in finding a nominee who can offer 
the best chance of beating the republicans in the fall 
gore and jackson are displaying vastly differing campaign 
styles gore is racking up endorsements from key political leaders 
and kicked off a massive media campaign last week 
jackson doesnt have the money for big media buys but his 
campaign manager gerald austin said that isnt important because 
jackson is already wellknown 
as for gores support from the democratic political 
establishment austin retorts were depending on the endorsement 
of the people not the house speakers and the like 
the wellfunded dukakis was spending heavily in delegaterich 
florida and texas and his organization is seen as strong 
especially in florida 
to mount a serious super tuesday television offensive a 
candidate must buy air time in 20 or more separate television 
markets that means big expenses a major factor for candidates 
like democrats richard gephardt and paul simon who are saddled 
with debt 
among republicans dole was kicking off his southern campaign 
with a news conference thursday at the georgia capitol 
despite bushs strong southern organization the best among the 
gop candidates in the view of some dole was banking on winning 
over a large undecided vote 
it doesnt surprise me when the people with the vice president 
say theyve got an organization that cant be matched down here 
said clay collins doles campaign director for georgia 
nonetheless he said we have the thrust to break through that 
invincibility myth i think we are going to make rapid gains 
bush however also was confident 
were going south and fight it looks good there bush said 
he was to campaign in missouri on thursday and in texas through the 
weekend 
robertson the former television evangelist has also shown a 
strong southern organization and his churchbacked following will 
be a formidable force in the bible belt 
but robertson also needs to regain momentum after his 
disappointing showing in new hampshire so hes looking to south 
carolinas gop primary on the saturday before super tuesday an 
expected low turnout combined with robertsons constituency of 
fundamentalist christian voters make that state a likely spot for 
an improved robertson performance heading into super tuesday

when sen joseph biden experienced a pain in 
the neck he was placed in a brace until it felt better but last 
week when the pain came back suddenly doctors found an aneurysm on 
the brain that required delicate surgery to save his life 
the surgery performed last friday was so successful that 
doctors at walter reed army medical center on tuesday transferred 
the 45yearold delaware democrat out of intensive care and into a 
regular hospital room 
physicians are pleased with his continued progress and his 
condition is listed as satisfactory said peter esker a walter 
reed spokesman 
a neurosurgeon familiar with the biden case said many patients 
with cerebral aneurysms are not as lucky particularly if there is 
rapid and serious bleeding 
it can kill you in 10 minutes said the surgeon who asked 
not to be named most patients survive he added but for a 
serious medical condition aneurysms on the brain are big time 
the doctor said that biden is in the lucky twothirds who 
live through cerebral aneurysm surgery and the senators 
relatively quick release from intensive care probably means he 
avoided a long list of problems that can ambush such patients 
one third of these patients die said the surgeon while 
others may experience some loss of function such as paralysis or 
decline of intellectual ability but if everything is perfect and 
the surgery is within 24 hours of serious bleeding they can be 
out of the hospital within seven days recovery can be absolutely 
normal 
dr edward laws chairman of the neurosurgery department at 
george washington hospital said he had no details on the biden 
case but that patients with successful surgery usually are released 
within a week or 10 days 
it sounds like he biden is doing better than that though 
said laws i think hes probably going to do great 
an aneurysm is caused by a weakness in the artery wall that 
allows pressure to force the artery to swell outward like a 
blister the danger is that the aneurysm will burst but in the 
brain even a mild leakage can be dangerous and damaging 
a leakage into the brain from a branch of the carotid artery can 
cause a neck pain but both laws and the other neurosurgeon said it 
is unusual for such a pain to be misdiagnosed 
laws suggested that biden in fact may have had a neck problem 
earlier and that development of the aneurysm which manifests a 
similar pain was just coincidental 
biden first complained of the neck pain in late january 
jane berman an aide in bidens washington office said when the 
senator sought medical care he was issued a brace 
they thought he had a pinched nerve and a viral infection in 
the neck at the same time she said 
biden chairman of the senate judiciary committee wore a neck 
brace in late january during hearings on the nomination of anthony 
kennedy to the supreme court a week later the senator was too ill 
to vote on the confirmation 
but last week biden felt well enough to take off the brace and 
accept several speaking engagements at east coast colleges ms 
berman said 
in rochester ny the pain returned suddenly and powerfully 
and biden also experienced nausea 
he went home to wilmington del and immediately was admitted 
to st francis hospital for tests 
one of these tests was a cat scan a sophisticated xray 
technique the aneurysm was spotted and biden quickly was 
transferred by ambulance early friday morning to walter reed where 
surgery began only hours later 
laws said that typically in such a procedure an incision is made 
in the temple area of the head surgeons then cut a small window 
through the wall of the skull and the brain is raised slightly to 
gain access to the aneurysm site 
to correct the flaw surgeons use a clip a small metal device 
with two tiny jaws that lock together the clip is placed at the 
base of the aneurysm parallel to the flow of blood left in place 
permanently the clip isolates the weak spot and allows the artery 
to heal 
the procedure said laws is microsurgery because the 
artery which he described as like a piece of wet spaghetti is 
so small 
it is very difficult and delicate surgery he said

president reagan is remaining mum 
on the battle for the republican presidential nomination as he 
heads back to washington and his regular weekly meeting with vice 
president george bush 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan watched 
returns from the new hampshire primary on television on tuesday as 
he wound up a threeday vacation at his ranch in the santa ynez 
mountains north of here 
we wont have any comment fitzwater said when asked about 
the new hampshire voting reagan has maintained a public stance of 
neutrality in the race for the nomination although he has 
repeatedly praised bushs performance as vice president 
in response to a question fitzwater said the bush campaign 
facing stiff competition from senate majority leader bob dole had 
made no requests that the president step up his commendation of the 
vice president he said reagan had not talked with bush in recent 
days 
the two are scheduled to have lunch at the white house on 
thursday as they do each week 
also on thursday the president will meet with bipartisan 
negotiators in congress who worked out the 11 trillion budget 
compromise to be formally unveiled that day fitzwater said reagan 
would tell them that it is a remarkable budget that includes 
more money for aids research more money for housing and education 
but makes cuts in other areas that will allow us to meet the budget 
reduction and keep the deficit on a downward path 
later thursday the president will attend the swearing in of 
judge anthony kennedy of the 9th us circuit court of appeals as a 
member of the supreme court he nominated kennedy after the senate 
rejected his nomination of robert bork and his second nominee 
judge douglas ginsburg withdrew in the face of reports of his 
marijuana use in earlier days 
on friday the president will meet with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl before leaving for camp david to spend the weekend 
at his final meeting with reporters in santa barbara fitzwater

vice president george bush said reports of his death had been 
greatly exaggerated his comeback may get the same treatment 
thats the way it is in the crucial highstakes doordie 
makeorbreak pickacliche contests that begin the season of 
competition for presidential nominations every state leaves an 
indelible imprint until the next state votes 
that sometimes means as long as a week 
the early omens circa 1988 point to a season of political 
trench warfare in which battle cries and claims to momentum yield 
to a long hard struggle to collect delegates one state at a time 
then one vote at a time until they add up to a nominating majority 
one week after he became the republicans leading loser bush 
gained a solid comeback victory in the new hampshire presidential 
primary tuesday 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis third among democrats in 
iowa won easily in nextdoor new hampshire and said that put him 
on a winning path that leads south 
sen bob dole claimed satisfaction in second place but it was 
way before midnight when he stopped smiling and started snarling at 
bush 
rep richard gephardt the democratic victor in the iowa 
caucuses said runner up and 20 percent of the vote was a solid 
showing and it was to the extent that he out paced fellow 
midwesterner paul simon for the second week running this isnt 
helping the illinois senator said in bowtied understatement 
sen simon polled 17 percent three points and a good many 
dollars short simon said if he could have reversed that narrow 
edge it would have made a tremendous difference in raising 
money which is in dangerously short supply in his campaign 
for all of that nobody was quitting outright not even former 
arizona gov bruce babbitt who got 5 percent and barely beat gary 
hart babbitt said hed talk with his supporters and figure out 
what to do next 
so coming out of iowa and new hampshire both political parties 
have confirmed what they knew going in bush is the man to beat in 
what looks like a twoway republican contest with pat robertson 
looking from the outside in 
the democrats have yet to pick a face from the crowd dukakis 
has what edge there is because he is the most recent winner but he 
is heading into difficult territory in the southern primaries that 
come up on march 8 super tuesday a victory next tuesday in 
minnesota would provide an undeniable boost 
to this point for all the effort and money they have spent the 
contestants have succeeded in eliminating alexander haig from the 
republican running and pushing democrat babbitt toward the exit 
neither of them had a chance in the first place 
robertson who embarrassed bush in iowa slumped to last place 
in new hampshire the former television evangelist acknowledged 
that hed come up short of his hopes but said he wasnt 
discouraged my natural base is down in the south and thats 
where we go from here robertson said 
rep jack kemp ran third with 13 percent he said that made him 
the winner in the competition to become the candidate of the 
conservative wing of the party or as he later billed it the 
progressive conservative wing he too said the south promised him 
a better lot 
pete du pont ran narrowly ahead of robertson 
democrats jesse jackson and sen albert gore jr said they too 
were aiming southward the black vote there is certain to boost 
jacksons showings gore decided to wait near his tennessee base 
for the rest of the field to come there super tuesday is a 
completely new ball game he said 
but it is a game in which there will be enough conflicting 
messages to enable most of the contestants to claim headway all 20 
contests are not in the south dukakis massachusetts and next 
door rhode island will be holding primaries on march 8 among the 
halfdozen outside the southern and border states

student protesters who have held a 
university of massachusetts building for five days began 
deliberating a tentative understanding late tuesday hammered out 
earlier in the day by their negotiators and university officials 
the students meeting was closed and there were conflicting 
signals on whether an end to the fiveday standoff which began 
when some 200 minority students took over the schools new africa 
house in a protest of campus racial tensions was near an end 
not all the students demands have been met but all have 
been responded to in good faith chancellor joseph duffey said as 
he forwarded a written statement to the students there are 
things i cannot do now but weve agreed to plan to address general 
concerns 
earlier university officials had said duffey would be putting 
into writting a tentative understanding reached between him and a 
ninemember student negotiating committee during a meeting that 
lasted nearly four hours 
it looks like we have a resolution said james langley a 
spokesman for duffey after the meeting broke up 
but a student spokesman said late in the evening that the 
document sent by duffey was received with mixed emotions by the 
entire student group and that discussions of what they would do 
next could last well into the night 
the vote is going very slowly spokesman roscoe robinson 
said im getting nervous 
earlier when the meeting with duffey was still in progress 
robinson had also expressed optimism on the way it were going 
saying he was pleased with the results 
jeanne hopkins university spokeswoman described the tentative 
understanding as an agenda for what well do where we will go 
from here 
administrators did not release the document sent to the 
students but dwayne warren another student spokesman said it 
contained a promise of further efforts to improve minority 
students condititions on the campus including increased support 
for minority organizations 
the day also saw a rally by more than 500 white umass students 
who supported the minority students protest 
hey ho chancellor joe racism has got to go was chanted by 
students who were held back by black students linking arms to 
clear a path for duffey as he walked toward the building 
students and faculty also read letters of support including a 
message sent tuesday by democratic presidential candidate jesse 
jackson some supporters had traveled from albany and philadelphia 
and local businesses and residents had sent protesters blankets 
pillows and food 
i came to see if they needed any help said michelle norman 
21 a senior from pleasanton calif who added that she was 
missing two classes to attend the vigil i think its a good 
cause 
jackson a democratic presidential contender who was in nearby 
new hampshire for tuesdays primary balloting called the 
protesters at 915 am to lend his support 
the students occupying the new africa house have taken a 
principled position on legitimate concerns the quality of 
leadership in the state and country can be determined by how it 
handles such crises as this one jackson said in a statement read 
by a protester 
the protesters had said they would meet with duffey to negotiate 
on a revised set of demands which a spokesman for the group 
declined to detail they vowed to remain until duffey agrees to 
their conditions 
the six original demands included a written policy against 
discrimination by the university prosecution of five white 
students accused of attacking two black men and a white woman on 
feb 7 and the suspension of campus police officers who allegedly 
formed a lineup of black men when women complained of harassment 
sara lennox a german professor said 50 faculty members have 
signed a statement deploring the recent incidents and urging the 
administration to resolve the dispute 
a climate of hostility danger and racial intolerance must not 
be allowed to continue said the statement signed by members of 
an ad hoc committee to promote racial tolerance the group was 
formed in response to a fight between black and white students 
following the world series in 1986 
the university rescheduled classes that usually meet in new 
africa house to other buildings 
we see this as a shortterm temporary thing we dont want to 
escalate tensions spokesman langley had said 
between 50 and 200 students remained in the building through the 
long holiday weekend according to robinson 24 of boston 
associate dean of students rick townes who is serving as 
mediator said the protesters were civil but determined 
there has been a resolve that this was going to be the last 
time they were going to make a stand townes said this is not 
a movement led by radical students these are good students tired 
of dealing with this 
a session between the protesters and duffy planned for monday 
was canceled because duffey left campus to visit an ailing brother 
the protesters sent duffey a sympathy card signed by more than 
200 students duffey responded by sending them a fruit basket and a 
card that read i send affection and respect 
about 9 percent of the 25000 students at the states largest 
public university are minorities there are 641 blacks enrolled at 
umass and about 500 of them are undergraduates langley said total 
undergraduate enrollment is approximately 19000 students

the latest appearance of a great white shark 
and norman mailers film of his own book received the dubious honor 
wednesday of being at the top of the pack as the golden raspberry 
award foundation announced its picks for worst pictures of 1987 
the 8th annual golden raspberry award nominations also went to 
bill cosby madonna sylvester stallone and the 35 million 
superflop ishtar as the foundation took note of what it felt 
was truly terrible in motion pictures last year 
jaws the revenge and tough guys dont dance received 
seven razzie nominations each with the acting considered so bad in 
the latest jaws sequel that even bruce the mechanical shark was 
nominated for worst actor 
the razzies are a lighthearted parody of the oscar ceremonies 
and coincide with the annual academy award nominations which will 
be announced wednesday 
the razzie ceremony will be held april 10 and will feature 
dramatic readings of the most ridiculous lyrics from some awful 
movie songs 
the winners if they dare to show up will receive a trophy of a 
golfball size raspberry glued atop a film reel and spraypainted 
with gold 
there are three basic theories of what qualifies as a 
razzie explained john wilson razzie foundation president 
first hollywoods own measure how much money did it lose 
second a movie that was not supposed to be a comedy that generated 
enormous laughs from the audience jaws was one of those and so 
was norman mailers tough guys dont dance which was laughed off 
the screen in cannes 
the last is how excruciating it is to actually sit through a 
film does someone have to pay you money or bribe you with popcorn 
whos that girl fits into that category he said 
cosby received three nominations for star author and producer 
of leonard part 6 a movie that he disavowed and almost no one 
saw madonna last years worst actress winner is a contender this 
year for whos that girl nominated for five razzies 
stallone the alltime razzie champ with four wins is 
continuing the tradition with the maudlin armwrestling 
melodrama over the top which got three nominations 
the golden raspberry foundation made up of film professionals 
and critics as well as frequent filmgoers in california and nine 
other states believe the worst pictures of 1987 were ishtar 
jaws the revenge leonard part 6 tough guys dont 
dance and whos that girl 
named for worst performances by an actor besides bruce the 
shark were cosby in leonard part 6 judd nelson in from the 
hip ryan oneal in tough guys dont dance and stallone in 
over the top 
worst actress nominations in addition to madonna went to 
sondra locke in ratboy lorraine gary in jaws debra 
sandlund in tough guys dont dance and sharon stone in allan 
quatermain and the lost city of gold 
worst supporting actor nominees are billy barty in masters of 
the universe tom bosley mack dryden and jamie alcroft all of 
million dollar mystery michael caine in jaws the revenge 
and david mendenhall in over the top

hemingway superman iv grace jones siesta and isabella 
rossellini for both siesta and tough guys dont dance

the agriculture department is looking for 
state and local business partners to help share the cost of 
upgrading recreational facilities on national forest lands 
f dale robertson chief of the departments forest service 
said tuesday the move is in response to increasing demands for more 
recreational areas and service and to help relieve pressures on 
federal spending 
the squeezed budget is a factor robertson told a news 
conference 
a spokesman for an environmental group the wilderness society 
supported the agencys program but with some reservation 
there definitely needs to be greater emphasis on recreation 
and i would applaud efforts on the part of the forest service to 
increase the emphasis on recreation said richard rice a society 
economist i would urge them to use caution in opening the door 
to private development however 
robertson said the challenge costshare program was 
authorized by congress on a pilot basis at a level of 500000 for 
the fiscal year that began last oct 1 of that 100000 was 
earmarked for the tonto national forest near phoenix ariz with 
the remainder available to other regions to supplement money put up 
by local people companies state agencies municipalities or other 
groups 
some 31 recreation projects have been approved and will be under 
way this spring and summer he said restoration and improvement of 
existing facilities areas and trails are typical goals 
the 500000 of forest service seed money was met with 908000 
from various partners involved in the 31 pilot projects 
one of the objectives of the program will be to provide more 
facilities on national forest land near cities 
private investors will be encouraged to develop new campgrounds 
marinas ski areas no increase in user fees is being proposed at 
this time but that eventually will have to be faced he said 
asked if the plan means opening the door for major private 
development on national forest land robertson replied 
yes we are opening that door but we also need to work with 
those private sector proposals to see if they fit into the overall 
scheme for recreation development 
the forest service administers 191 million acres or about 8 
percent of the us total land area 
robertson said the proposed budget that president reagan is 
scheduled to send congress on thursday for the 1989 fiscal year 
that will begin on oct 1 will include 3 million for the 
recreation costshare program up from the 500000 in pilot funds 
this year one that began in 1986 for fish and wildlife will be 
requested at 5 million compared with 15 million in fiscal 1988

former antitrust chief douglas h ginsburg 
dealt with 16 different cable industry matters while holding cable 
stock but either his role or his chance for personal gain was too 
small to violate federal conflictofinterest laws the justice 
department says 
the departments decision not to request appointment of an 
independent counsel for further investigation of the former supreme 
court nominee was detailed in a 116page report released tuesday 
the report by assistant attorney general william f weld head 
of the departments criminal division summarized the results of a 
threemonth inquiry in which justice and fbi officials interviewed 
more than 50 people including ginsburg 
ginsburg did not return telephone calls seeking his reaction 
but his lawyers had joined the department in asking that the report 
be released to the public 
the report was released by the division of the us circuit 
court of appeals here that appoints independent counsels to 
investigate alleged wrongdoing by high federal officials 
but the justice departments office of government ethics says it 
wants to read the report before deciding whether to do or say 
anything about the case according to its general counsel donald 
campbell 
separate from the criminal sanctions a presidential executive 
order prohibits actions that might give an appearance of conflict 
the penalty for violating this is administrative discipline 
but ginsburg has since become a member of the judicial branch 
sitting on the us court of appeals here all the ethics office or 
any other executive branch agency could do now is issue a letter or 
reprimand for a former employee 
weld said the department conducted a preliminary inquiry into 
three matters that had been reported in news accounts in addition 
department investigators came up with 13 other instances of 
ginsburgs involvement in cable issues but weld said these did not 
even merit a preliminary inquiry 
ginsburg withdrew from consideration as a supreme court justice 
last november after he acknowledged that he had smoked marijuana 
while a professor at harvard law school 
the investigation covered a period from 1983 to 1986 in which he 
was either assistant attorney general in charge of justices 
antitrust division or a deputy to the chief 
during this period his only substantial stock holding was about 
140000 worth of rogers communications inc a canadianbased 
cable operator which is also among the top 15 us cable operators 
the news reports about the cable dealings triggered the justice 
inquiry that began last november and was concluded with the feb 6 
report released tuesday the marijuana use was not a subject in the 
inquiry because no federal laws were violated 
in one of the newly disclosed instances weld concluded that 
ginsburgs stock in rogers communications inc might have risen in 
value as a result of ginsburgs participation in a copyright 
infringement case before the supreme court 
he said ginsburgs participation including ordering a brief 
opposing supreme court review of the case and editing an early 
draft was substantial as required by the conflictofinterest laws 
and weld said that case might have relieved rogers of paying 
some fees for transmitting copyright programs over its cable 
systems judge ginsburg through his ownership of class b shares 
of rci may have had an interest in rcis no longer paying the 
transmission fee weld wrote 
but weld added that any such interest would be remote direct 
and infinitesimal in addition he said ginsburg did not appear 
to be aware of his financial interest 
in one case in which the department did conduct a preliminary 
inquiry weld concluded that ginsburg participated personally and 
substantially in a friendofthecourt brief to the supreme court 
in that case the high court for the first time extended first 
amendment protection to cable operators 
but weld said officials questioned by the department differed on 
whether and how much rogers would be helped or hurt by this ruling 
in two previously reported matters involving comments filed by 
the antitrust division with the federal communications commission 
weld concluded that ginsburgs role was tangential and 
unimportant in one case and insubstantial in the other 
weld handled the matter as acting attorney general because 
attorney general edwin meese iii and four other more senior justice 
department officials decided to take no part in the case

an unsually large soviet pledge of 250000 
tons of grain to famineplagued ethiopia has generated surprise 
among us officials but concern over who will pay for delivery 
the us agency for international development has officially 
welcomed the soviet commitment pointing out that it has encouraged 
all potential donors to make a contribution to easing ethiopias 
plight 
as one of the worlds largest grain importers it is somewhat 
unusual for moscow to play the role of food donor but ethiopia is 
a close kremlin ally and has benefited for years from western food 
conributions 
according to agriculture department figures the soviet union is 
expected to purchase about 32 million tons of grain during the year 
ending next june 30 but soviet grain harvests have been 
comparatively good during 198687 surpassing 200 million tons in 
consecutive years for the first time 
the soviet pledge was made three weeks ago generating surprise 
here because the largest previous donation by moscow to ethiopia 
was 10000 metric tons of rice during the 198485 famine 
the latest food shortage is primarily the result of a severe 
drought last summer 
the 250000ton pledge exceeds the us commitment by about 
3000 tons an aid statement said the combined contribution of 
western nations exceeds half a million tons 
the major unanswered question us officials are asking is who 
will pick up the cost of distributing the soviet deliveries 
aid said it would have no objection if private voluntary 
organizations working in ethiopia help in distribution of the 
soviet grains but no request has been made thus far 
we naturally assume that the soviets will fund the cost of 
distribution as aid has done for food provided by the us 
government the agency said estimating at 25 million the cost 
of delivering the soviet shipments 
a us official said that the soviets have provided transport 
aircraft to ethiopia for food distribution in the past as well as 
trucks and soviet drivers

existing homes rose 51 percent to a national average of 84300 at 
the close of last year slightly ahead of consumer inflation which

differences home prices shot up 322 percent in providence ri 
six times the national average three other eastern cities albany 
ny hartford conn and washington also saw home prices climb 
by 18 percent or more

found 14 cities where prices fell during the year this list was 
dominated by areas dependent on farming and energy industries 
houston suffered the biggest price decline a drop of 72 
percent followed by declines of 56 percent in oklahoma city and 
55 percent in des moines des moines was ranked as the most 
affordable place to buy a home last year with a median price of 
52000 
at the top of the price scale were new york city with a 
midpoint price of 180800 and boston with a selling price of 
178600 at the end of last year these two cities have held the 
top two price positions for the past two years 
despite volatile mortgage rates and the october collapse of the 
stock market home sales remained near eightyear highs last year 
sales totaled 3885 million units in 1987 down a tiny 03 percent 
from 1986 both years represented the fastest sales pace since 405 
million homes were sold in 1979 
alaska and louisiana two states which had suffered a big slump 
in sales because of depressed energy industries enjoyed a rebound 
last year leading the country along with massachusetts with the 
largest percentage gains 
sales in alaska rose 262 percent and were up 188 percent in 
louisiana and massachusetts twentytwo states had sales increases 
last year 
others enjoying big gains were georgia with an 185 percent 
increase and north dakota and maine with advances of 179 percent 
and 143 percent respectively 
the northeast continues as the strongest region but we saw 
considerable strength in the south and midwest two areas which had 
been lagging the rest of the country said john tuccillo chief 
economist for the realtors group 
twentytwo states suffered sales declines last year led by a 
138 percent drop in washington state a decline which erased a 
155 percent gain of the previous year sales fell 133 percent in 
virginia followed by declines of 97 percent in both maryland and 
oklahoma 
analysts said that one factor which pushed up 1986 sales was a 
lastminute rush to close sales and reap capital gains profits 
before the new tax law took effect on jan 1 1987 
tuccillo predicted that price increases nationwide should be 
lower than the 51 percent rise in 1987 with sales expected to 
decline by around 8 percent in part because of slower economic 
growth 
tuccillo predicted that the northeast will continue to have the 
highest home prices of any region but he said the rate of increase 
should slow 
a leveling off is occurring after a long period of overheated 
activity he said the losses incurred by those in the new york 
financial community are still having a lagging effect on home 
buying in that area

the new ussoviet nuclear missile pact is 
seriously flawed but its defeat in the senate would be a 
politically unacceptable blow to the unity of the nato alliance 
two national security experts say 
richard perle who recently stepped down as assistant secretary 
of defense for international security affairs is trying to 
persuade the senate to change the mediumrange missile treaty 
he told the senate foreign relations committee on tuesday that 
the pact should permit the united states to deploy mediumrange 
groundlaunched cruise missiles armed with nonnuclear explosives 
but perle said that if it became clear such an amendment would 
have the effect of killing the treaty i would not favor it 
retired army gen bernard rogers until recently the supreme 
allied commander in europe told the committee that he believes the 
treaty overall will have an adverse impact on the military 
situation in europe he said us pershing missiles which are to 
be destroyed under the treaty are the one weapon that can strike 
with assurance deep into soviet territory from western europe 
but he said the senate is faced with a nowin situation because 
it would be almost impossible politically for the united states to 
keep its mediumrange nuclear missile force in europe even if the 
treaty were defeated 
i would say that failure to ratify might well have a major 
negative impact on nato and the future viability of the alliance 
rogers said 
he said the alliance must now insist on modernizing its force of 
shortrange nuclear weapons remaining in europe as a hedge against 
soviet aggression 
both perle and rogers questioned whether soviet compliance with 
the new treaty could be adequately verified 
but in closeddoor hearings before the senate intelligence 
committee a different sort of worry surfaced about the treatys 
verifications provisions 
the concern centered on the onsite inspection provisions of the 
treaty which apply to both sides and permit teams of soviet 
officials access to certain us missile facilities 
i think onsite inspection presents problems said one 
committee source one of the things were trying to figure out is 
how to keep tabs on the soviets who are coming here 
its for sure theyre going to be interested in a lot more 
than looking at disneyland the source said speaking on 
condition he not be identified by name 
the fbi has responsibility for counterintelligence but fbi 
officials have balked at taking on the job of watching the soviet 
inspectors said committee sources 
instead they reported fbi officials have suggested that the 
army should be given the task 
meanwhile sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed 
services committee reporting on a weeklong trip by senate leaders 
to europe said he found a european consensus for modernizing 
shortrange nuclear weapons but no agreement on which weapons to 
build 
majority leader robert byrd dwva said european leaders told 
the senators that the inf treaty should be approved without 
amendments and that following that nato should proceed with 
modernizing those groundbased nuclear weapons that are eligible 
under the treaty

attorney general edwin meese iii will decide 
as promptly as he can whether two detroit newspapers should be 
allowed to merge their business and production operations 
on tuesday the last day for filing briefs before the case went 
to meese attorneys for the detroit news and the detroit free press 
said denial of the joint operating agreement application would 
result in the closure of the 156yearold free press and the loss 
of 2200 newspaper jobs 
under a joint operating agreement the newspapers would split 
profits and combine their advertising circulation and production 
departments but would retain separate news and editorial 
departments 
the newspapers said a joint operating agreement would result in 
the elimination of 600 to 1000 jobs 
the application was filed under the newspaper preservation act 
designed to prop up newspapers in danger of financial failure as a 
means of preserving competing editorial voices in cities 
the issue is decided in a quasijudicial process with the 
justice departments antitrust division presenting arguments 
against the proposed agreement and the newspapers arguing for it 
the attorney general acts as an impartial judge in making the final 
ruling on the application 
mark sheehan justice department spokesman said meese will 
act as promptly as he can but that he probably will want his 
staff to review and analyze the case first 
the news is owned by gannett co and the free press is owned by 
knightridder inc the two papers have long been locked in a battle 
for newspaper dominance in detroit 
the news which is the larger newspaper has lost 75 million 
since 1979 and the free press has lost 100 million according to 
knightridder 
final briefs by the newspapers and the antitrust division 
included discussion of the weight meese should give to a decision 
in january by directors of knightridder to close the free press if 
a joa is disapproved 
the antitrust division contends that when the newspapers 
announced their application for the joint operating agreement in 
1986 knightridder was willing to continue subsidizing the free 
press 
whether a newspaper is failing within the meaning of the 
newspaper preservation act should properly be determined as of 
the time it enters into a joa agreement not on the basis of 
decisions made in the face of subsequent failure to win approval 
under the statute the division said 
the newspapers countered that the boards announcement made it 
clear that the choice now is between a joa and the certain 
closure of the free press 
local 22 of the newspaper guild which represents editorial 
employees voted 34984 monday night to continue opposition to the 
joa 
but a brief filed by the newspapers included statements by five 
other unions representing news and free press employees 
withdrawing opposition to the proposed agreement 
those unions said the joa is the only way to assure the 
survival of the free press and the preservation of two independent 
editorial voices in detroit

us trade officials have reiterated to japan 
that they will not extend a fouryear agricultural quota agreement 
beyond its march 31 expiration date 
the agreement includes japanese quotas on imports of american 
beef and citrus fruit restrictions to which us officials now 
object 
japanese agriculture ministry official hidero maki was informed 
of the us position during a visit here last week said gary 
holmes a spokesman for the us trade representatives office 
us refusal to extend the fouryear quota agreement carried the 
implied threat of taking japanese import barriers against us 
citrus and beef before the international panel that resolves 
disputes under the general agreement on tariffs and trade known as 
gatt us trade representative clayton yeutter has said that 
possibility would be considered 
the expiring quotas cover fresh beef and fruit the united 
states earlier asked for a gatt ruling on japanese restrictions on 
the import of 12 categories of processed us foodstuffs officials 
said during the visit of prime minister noboru takeshita last month 
that japan would abide by gatt findings 
imports of foreign agricultural products are a sensitive 
political issue in japan because of resistance from strong rural 
factions of takeshitas governing liberaldemocratic party 
although japan is already the best customer for american farm 
products us officials maintain that the huge us trade deficit 
with japan and high consumer prices for homegrown foodstuffs 
justify a freer japanese market for imports

a woman seeking psychiatric help in a hospital 
emergency room suddenly shot a social worker to death with a 
handgun and held three people hostage before surrendering tuesday 
night police said 
edith anderson 31 of suburban rankin was arrested on homicide 
and related charges in st francis medical center in the citys 
bloomfield neighborhood at about 1015 pm according to police 
cmdr ron freeman

assume side by side

latedeciding republican voters confounded the 
polls and boosted george bush to his convincing victory over sen 
bob dole in the new hampshire presidential primary analysts say 
voters who made their choice in the races final days went 
strongly for bush in part because of his superior campaign 
organization his ties to the reagan administration and his 
experience in office exit polls indicated tuesday 
the result was a 9point victory for the vice president after 
some polls had shown him leading dole just barely by 4 points in a 
cbs newsnew york times poll and 2 points in an abc newswashington 
post survey 
the voters of new hampshire have a welldeserved reputation of 
upsetting poll results and tonight was a good example of that 
said nbc news pollster laurily epstein people change their 
minds and you cant poll for that 
an nbc newswall street journal exit poll found that 14 percent 
of the gop voters in new hampshire made up their minds on primary 
day with 36 percent going for bush and 29 percent for dole 
another 11 percent decided during the weekend breaking 44 percent 
for bush to 31 percent for dole 
it was the undecideds the undecideds went for bush said 
john berrigan a poll analyst for abc news a key reason bushs 
identification with president reagan who is very popular among new 
hampshire republicans 
the reagan coattails were there said jerry strom an nbc 
news poll consultant people who like reagan were going strongly 
for bush 
nbcs exit poll supported that contention threequarters of 
republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set 
by reagan 88 percent of bushs supporters held that view compared 
with 66 percent of doles 
there were fewer reagan backers in iowa and more of them went 
for dole than for bush albeit narrowly in the precinct caucuses 
feb 8 dole won big there while bush suffered a thirdplace 
embarrassment 
berrigan said new hampshires economic vitality could explain 
reagans popularity in that state and its benefit for bush you 
may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here a belief 
that there may be a threat if i dont go with someone whos 
following the same line he said 
perhaps for similar reasons a third of republicans said 
experience was the chief factor in their vote and 54 percent of 
them voted for bush to 37 percent for dole the cbstimes poll 
said dole won among republicans looking chiefly for a strong 
leader with 48 percent to 21 percent for bush but that group made 
up just 19 percent of the gop total 
another key for bush was his extensive campaign organization in 
new hampshire the cbstimes poll found that 47 percent of bushs 
backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his 
organization while just 26 percent of doles supporters reported 
contact by the dole campaign 
i think the thing that won it for bush was his organization 
said warren mitofsky polling chief at cbs news 
while the polls did not anticipate the extent of bushs victory 
mitofsky said they did identify trends in the race bush way ahead 
before the iowa caucuses dropping sharply after losing to dole and 
pat robertson in iowa then halting his slide and rebounding during 
the weekend 
speaking on cbs bush credited his victory to a surge of support 
in the last 48 hours i learned from that fight back fight 
on he said its taught me a good lesson do not be 
discouraged by the polling numbers 
the exit poll results were less remarkable on the democratic 
side where michael dukakis won handily as expected abc had him 
winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in 
organization 
the poll results also indicated dukakis backyard advantage abc 
said 55 percent of democrats rated dukakis above average as 
governor of neighboring massachusetts and 59 percent of them voted 
for him moreover the cbstimes poll found that 20 percent of new 
hampshires democratic voters moved there from massachusetts and 
four in 10 of them went for dukakis 
rep richard gephardts secondplace finish appeared to be aided 
by his firstplace showing in iowa of the voters who made up their 
minds after iowa 27 percent went to gephardt 26 percent to 
dukakis and 20 percent to sen paul simon who finished second in 
iowa and third in new hampshire

george bush the formal patrician 
republican whose presidential bid had been thrown into sudden peril 
with a trouncing in iowa stood in the lot at cuzzin richies 
truckstop 
this is the real me he insisted climbing into the cab of 
an 18wheeler this is my home turf 
it was three days after the vice president had been crushed in 
an embarrassing thirdplace finish in last weeks iowa caucuses 
bob dole riding the wave out of iowa was surging here in new 
hampshire 
but then came the new george bush and his new campaign with a 
uturn in style and approach bush came back and blunted doles 
surge with a big victory in tuesdays new hampshire primary 
bushs formidable organization swung into high gear the vice 
presidents association with president reagan which had hurt him 
in iowa proved a big plus here one that bush milked for all it 
was worth 
and an eleventhhour advertising campaign attacking dole and 
touting the support of barry goldwater helped bring him back from 
the edge of the abyss 
the vice president went from a 20point edge over dole before 
iowa to as much as 8 points behind but the tracking polls said 
dole peaked about friday the day the bush campaign hit the 
airwaves with a new ad accusing dole of straddling major issues 
in nearly final returns tuesday bush held a 9point margin over 
bush 3829 
on the night of his big defeat in iowa bush seemed stunned 
asked if his big entourage secret service protection and 
armslength style were getting in the way of reaching the people 
bush answered that he wasnt sure 
still shaky the next day bush started before dawn to greet 
workers at a factory gate but few workers used that entrance and 
bush spent a good portion of the time talking to reporters 
then bush tried out a new slogan im one of you born in 
new england and with a home in neighboring maine bush appealed to 
granite state voters as his neighbors but he drifted away from the 
slogan which was too close to the hes one of us theme dole 
had used in iowa 
then 36 hours after iowa new hampshire voters saw the new 
george bush 
canceling a swing through the south bush flew back in from his 
weekly lunch in washington with president reagan and went to the 
giant pheasant lane shopping mall in nashua to shake hands late 
wednesday 
munching a chocolatechip cookie bush shook hands with dozens 
of voters and heard some of them say he had their vote 
thats good to hear he told one supporter its a good 
morale booster 
with that gone were the formal events the speeches the town 
meetings with the carefully orchestrated crowds 
now it was the informal george and impromptu campaign stops 
the first came at the east coast lumberyard in east hampstead 
nh there in a casual coat and a cap bush shook hands with 
customers and staff and drove a giant forklift around the yard it 
was all for the benefit of the media so the voters could see bush 
mixing with people and doing everyday tasks 
then it was onto cuzzin richies near portsmouth on the 
seacoast he talked to truckers and drove a semirig around the 
block with a secret service man hanging off the mirror and the 
armored limousine right behind 
to go with the new freewheeling style were tough new ads hitting 
at dole 
one labeled dole as a man who had straddled the issues of taxes 
the inf treaty and an oil import fee 
another a fiveminute electioneve buy featured barry 
goldwater known as mr conservative backing bush still another 
hit at dole for backing a national economic commission 
that exists to provide political cover for a tax hike if it 
doesnt recommend a tax increase ill not only eat my hat ill 
eat bob doles hat bush said in the ad 
bush continued to campaign in malls and stores and nursing 
homes reaching out to people directly in the retail campaigning 
style that the state once insisted upon he brought baseball great 
ted williams to the state to add a celebrity touch to the final 
days 
all the while his wellrespected organization was cranking away 
at high speed focused on getting its 40000 potential supporters 
to the polls 
the final piece of the puzzle was bush himself 
a private man in a public job bush was forced to begin talking 
about himself not as a public official but as a person 
mostly these days i think of lincoln here i stand warts 
and all he told a group of senior citizens in portsmouth 
i have a tendency and i will confess to it to avoid going 
on and on with great eloquent statements of belief there may be 
better orators out there but nobody believes more strongly 
maybe in some ways im a little more taciturn than i could be 
he said 
i care too much to quit now so can you help me 
new hampshire republicans heard and heeded that plea

a former employee of a silicon valley 
defense contractor fatally shot seven people and wounded five 
others at the companys offices tuesday including a woman who had 
spurned him authorities said 
the man identified by police as richard wade farley 39 
surrendered after barricading himself inside the building for about 
six hours three officers grabbed him as he walked out with his 
hands in the air and he was taken to the santa clara county jail in 
nearby san jose 
employees dove under desks and inside closets as the gunman shot 
his way into the twostory esl corp buiding witnesses said 
as the siege continued into the evening police negotiators 
talked by telephone with the man who at times was tearful and 
expressed a little remorse for his actions said lt tom moore 
of the sunnyvale public safety department 
two women and five men were killed said alex michaelis 
commander of the safety department they were not immediately 
identified 
the gunman who was fired from the company three years ago had 
called police and said he shot three people on the first floor 
and as many on the second floor said capt al scott of the 
safety department he was armed with a rifle shotgun and two 
handguns scott said 
one woman was listed in critical condition two others were in 
good condition the condition of two other victims was not 
immediately available 
the gunman said he entered the building planning to destroy 
equipment but began shooting employees because he felt threatened 
by them according to lt rueben grijalva the chief police 
negotiator 
on the second floor he saw laura black the woman who had 
rejected his advances grijalva said she slammed an office door in 
his face and he shot her through the door wounding her in the 
shoulder 
at least three people had been reported holed up in a computer 
room and making telephone calls to police while others were able 
to escape 
the shooting began about 230 pm at the subsidiary of trw 
about 40 miles south of san francisco near san jose 
i saw a man walk up and i didnt really pay attention and then 
just shortly later i heard bang large bangs and i realized it 
must be shots said witness norma kessler who hid in her office 
i was in the office by myself and i closed the door and it 
locked and i got underneath my desk and i must have heard about 50 
different shots over a period of time i must have been in there 
maybe 20 minutes something like that 
nearby police found a motor home they believe was driven by the 
gunman inside officers found a quantity of ammunition full cans 
of gasoline and other explosive material scott said 
black had been a target of farleys affections for about four 
years moore said farley who worked at esl as a computer software 
technician reportedly followed black and black had tried to obtain 
a restraining order to keep him away he said the two were never 
believed to have dated he said 
it was described to me a situation that had turned into 
harassment he had according to him had given her a warning and

the reagan administration says withdrawal of 
some warships in the persian gulf represents a finetuning of 
the us presence but it also is voicing concern over the conduct 
of iraqi forces in the region 
there are currently 28 ships in the region but the helicopter 
carrier okinawa the battleship iowa and two escorts are coming 
home without being replaced assistant secretary of defense richard 
armitage said tuesday 
our mission of protecting us flag ships in the gulf remains 
unchanged armitage said we dont think the overall threat 
has abated however we think weve learned a lot of lessons in the 
minesweeping area and this allows us primarily to pull out some 
of the ships 
armitage said the pentagon no longer thinks it needs 
minesweeping helicopters along with minesweeping ships clearing 
the way for the okinawas departure 
armitage in charge of international security affairs also said 
the united states already had protested to baghdad an incident 
saturday in which an iraqi jet fired a missile near a us 
destroyer 
he said the administration planned to send a team of military 
officials to iraq later this week to discuss the matter further 
armitage also said that the administration had no plans to offer 
military protection to usowned ships flying foreign flags 
in santa barbara calif white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said this represents a finetuning of our position in the gulf 
and not a policy change that would be reflected in overall forces 
or in other countries actions 
the remarks by armitage were the first reflecting official 
administration concern about iraqi military operations near us 
ships the united states thought it had won iraqi agreement after 
the deadly attack on the uss stark last may to keep jet fighters 
roughly 40 miles away from american warships 
in saturdays incident an iraqi jet failed to respond to navy 
radio calls and fired a missile that passed close to the destroyer 
chandler during a convoy operation 
armitage announced other moves that had been previously outlined 
jan 26 
the aircraft carrier enterprise has just replaced the carrier 
midway in the northern arabian sea making it easier to order the 
iowa home the enterprise is a much larger nuclearpowered carrier 
with a larger air wing than that aboard the midway 
the command ship of the middle east force the lasalle will 
soon be replaced in a routine rotation by the coronado 
the amphibious landing ship portland is being replaced by the 
amphibious landing ship trenton which will be carrying marine 
cobra attack copters

latedeciding republican voters confounded the 
polls and boosted george bush to his convincing victory over sen 
bob dole in the new hampshire presidential primary analysts say 
voters who made their choice in the races final days went 
strongly for bush in part because of his superior campaign 
organization his ties to the reagan administration and his 
experience in office exit polls indicated tuesday 
the result was a 9point victory for the vice president after 
some polls had shown him leading dole just barely by 4 points in a 
cbs newsnew york times poll and 2 points in an abc newswashington 
post survey 
the voters of new hampshire have a welldeserved reputation of 
upsetting poll results and tonight was a good example of that 
said nbc news pollster laurily epstein people change their 
minds and you cant poll for that 
an nbc newswall street journal exit poll found that 14 percent 
of the gop voters in new hampshire made up their minds on primary 
day with 36 percent going for bush and 29 percent for dole 
another 11 percent decided during the weekend breaking 44 percent 
for bush to 31 percent for dole 
it was the undecideds the undecideds went for bush said 
john berrigan a poll analyst for abc news a key reason bushs 
identification with president reagan who is very popular among new 
hampshire republicans 
the reagan coattails were there said jerry strom an nbc 
news poll consultant people who like reagan were going strongly 
for bush 
nbcs exit poll supported that contention threequarters of 
republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set 
by reagan 88 percent of bushs supporters held that view compared 
with 66 percent of doles 
there were fewer reagan backers in iowa and more of them went 
for dole than for bush albeit narrowly in the precinct caucuses 
feb 8 dole won big there while bush suffered a thirdplace 
embarrassment 
berrigan said new hampshires economic vitality could explain 
reagans popularity in that state and its benefit for bush you 
may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here a belief 
that there may be a threat if i dont go with someone whos 
following the same line he said 
perhaps for similar reasons a third of republicans said 
experience was the chief factor in their vote and 54 percent of 
them voted for bush to 37 percent for dole the cbstimes poll 
said dole won among republicans looking chiefly for a strong 
leader with 48 percent to 21 percent for bush but that group made 
up just 19 percent of the gop total 
another key for bush was his extensive campaign organization in 
new hampshire the cbstimes poll found that 47 percent of bushs 
backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his 
organization while just 26 percent of doles supporters reported 
contact by the dole campaign 
i think the thing that won it for bush was his organization 
said warren mitofsky polling chief at cbs news 
while the polls did not anticipate the extent of bushs victory 
mitofsky said they did identify trends in the race bush way ahead 
before the iowa caucuses dropping sharply after losing to dole and 
pat robertson in iowa then halting his slide and rebounding during 
the weekend 
speaking on cbs bush credited his victory to a surge of support 
in the last 48 hours i learned from that fight back fight 
on he said its taught me a good lesson do not be 
discouraged by the polling numbers 
the exit poll results were less remarkable on the democratic 
side where michael dukakis won handily as expected abc had him 
winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in 
organization 
the poll results also indicated dukakis backyard advantage abc 
said 55 percent of democrats rated dukakis above average as 
governor of neighboring massachusetts and 59 percent of them voted 
for him moreover the cbstimes poll found that 20 percent of new 
hampshires democratic voters moved there from massachusetts and 
four in 10 of them went for dukakis 
rep richard gephardts secondplace finish appeared to be aided 
by his firstplace showing in iowa of the voters who made up their 
minds after iowa 27 percent went to gephardt 26 percent to 
dukakis and 20 percent to sen paul simon who finished second in 
iowa and third in new hampshire

republican george bush and democrat michael 
dukakis leave new hampshire today with a slight bump in their 
delegate totals that keeps them both on top in the race for their 
parties presidential nominations 
but the lift from the early primaries and caucuses is more 
psychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1139 
delegates needed to win the republican presidential nomination or 
the 2082 delegates for the democratic nomination 
vice president bush who picked up 38 percent of the republican 
vote in tuesdays primary gained 11 of new hampshires 23 
delegates to the gop national convention in all bush now has 61 
delegates 
dukakis who got 36 percent of the democratic vote in the 
primary won 9 of the states 18 pledged delegates to that national 
convention the massachusetts governor has 445 delegates 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas gained 7 delegates 
in new hampshire to bring his national total to 42 while rep jack 
kemp of new york won 3 delegates to raise his total to 35 
rep richard gephardt of missouri the winner of last weeks 
iowa democratic caucuses gained 6 national convention delegates 
for his secondplace showing in new hampshire and sen paul simon 
of illinois followed with 3 delegates in the popular vote in new 
hampshire gephardt won 20 percent while simon had 17 percent 
gephardt now has 39 delegates while simon has 33 
under democratic party rules the national convention delegates 
were awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15 
percent of the vote in effect that disqualified jesse jackson 
sen albert gore of tennessee former arizona gov bruce babbitt 
and former colorado sen gary hart from receiving any delegates 
from new hampshire 
jackson won 8 percent of the vote gore 7 percent babbitt 5 
percent and hart 4 percent 
new hampshire republicans have a similar rule but the threshold 
is 10 percent that meant former delaware gov pete du pont who 
had 101 percent picked up 2 delegates but former television 
evangelist pat robertson who was within 1100 votes of du pont 
received no delegates because he had just 95 percent of the vote 
robertson already had 8 delegates while du pont had none before 
tuesdays primary 
among the democrats gore already had 1055 delegates jackson 
had 98 and babbitt had 4 
the delegate totals for the republicans include results from 
michigan kansas pennsylvania new hampshire and guam although 
iowa and hawaii both have held gop caucuses precise delegate 
figures cannot be calculated until later because of the way the 
selection process is structured 
the democratic totals include results from iowa and new 
hampshire as well as an associated press survey of democratic 
governors and democratic national committee members who will serve 
automatically as delegates to their partys convention some of the 
democratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention

cuba the ship was dented and there were no injuries but the 
united states formally apologized to poland and the fbi cracked 
down on militant anticastro groups

battle over custody of baby m a network spokeswoman said 
the twopart movie to air at an undetermined date this spring 
will also feature john shea dabney coleman and bruce weitz abc 
spokeswoman laurel whitcomb said tuesday 
the goal of the movie is to tell the story without adopting 
any one point of view ms whitcomb said in a telephone interview 
from los angeles 
the movie will include an update at the end because the case is 
still unfolding ms whitcomb said

upheld a 10000 contract under which mrs whiteheadgould was 
artificially inseminated with william sterns sperm and bore the 
child for him and his wife elizabeth 
in addition to stripping mrs whiteheadgould of her parental 
rights the lower court last march 31 awarded custody to the sterns 
the supreme court maintained custody for the sterns but voided 
the contract and ruled that mrs whiteheadgould was entitled to a 
hearing on visiting the child 
attorneys for mrs whiteheadgould and the sterns have agreed to 
try to reach an outofcourt settlement on visitation rights 
mrs whiteheadgoulds attorney harold cassidy said tuesday

has agreed to call the child melissa and do whatever it takes to 
achieve harmony the attorney said

gov evan mechams right to a fair trial 
in criminal court will be severely harmed if his impeachment trial 
starts monday as scheduled his lawyer told the arizona senate 
mecham attorney murray miller said tuesday that conducting the 
impeachment trial first would subject the criminal trial to 
prejudicial publicity 
in my judgment he will be convicted in the criminal trial if 
this matter the impeachment trial is going to proceed and he is 
convicted here miller said it just is in the cards and i 
fear for his liberty 
the senate was expected to decide late today whether to delay 
the impeachment trial senate president carl kunasek a republican 
said he expected the senate to approve some type of delay but he 
would not predict how long it would be 
miller said that if the senate decides to go ahead with the 
trial next week he will ask a court to halt it however some 
senators have questioned whether the courts have the authority to 
order the legislature to delay an impeachment trial 
the senate also decided to wait until today to reconsider a 
policy that allows all 30 senators to meet in closed conference 
during the impeachment trial 
the house approved 23 articles of impeachment against the 
republican governor feb 5 accusing him of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund 
and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by 
a state official 
mecham is scheduled to stand trial march 9 on six felony charges 
contained in an indictment that accuse him of fraud perjury and 
filing false documents in connection with the 350000 loan he 
also faces a march 17 recall election 
miller said the senate trial should be delayed until after the 
criminal trial or at least delayed 90 days to give him more time 
to prepare his case 
the house impeachment board of managers which is overseeing the 
prosecution in the senate trial said in a written response that 
the arizona constitution does not require the senate to await the 
outcome of mechams criminal trial 
the fivemember house board said a delay would leave the state 
government in limbo mecham has asked secretary of state rose 
mofford who is acting governor not to accept resignations from 
his staff and not to approve any tax increases which he opposes 
house counsel william french said the criminal trial would not 
be over until mid to late may at the earliest i think thats 
too long for the state of arizona to remain in a flux he said 
senate majority leader bob usdane a republican said he had 
examined the records of other impeachment trials and did not find 
that they had been delayed until after related criminal trials 
the senate met briefly tuesday in a closed session to discuss 
whether it should change its rule on closed conferences during the 
trial the conferences would be intended to let senators meet with 
their lawyers discuss possible questions to be asked and possibly 
to hold final deliberations 
the policy has been criticized by the media and 11 senators 
boycotted tuesdays closed meeting

native alaskan fishermans organization to stop the accidental 
taking of sea lions fur seals white porpoises and killer whales 
that could be ensnared in the ninemilelong gillnets 
as issued by the secretary of commerce the threeyear permit 
would have allowed the japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5250 
dalls porpoises in the northern pacific ocean including 789 in 
the bering sea

fishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took

supreme court justice antonin scalia says 
there isnt enough give and take at the private conferences the 
justices hold to review appeals and vote on pending cases 
scalia the newest sitting justice in an address at the george 
washington university law school said calling what the justices do 
a conference is a misnomer 
not very much conferencing goes on scalia said i dont 
like that maybe its because im new or an exacademic maybe 
because i am right 
scalia said the primary purposes of the conferences are to 
provide an opportunity for the justices to state their views on 
cases and to tally up their votes 
the conferences are held weekly when the court is in session 
only the members of the court attend the closeddoor meetings in 
which they decide whether to hear particular appeals and make final 
decisions on cases in which they have heard arguments 
scalia became a justice in 1986 and will be joined by on the 
court by anthony m kennedy who will be sworn in thursday as the 
ninth member filling a vacancy created when justice lewis f

a federal appeals court has ruled the humane 
society has legal standing to challenge the expansion of hunting on 
federal wildlife preserves 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals tuesday 
overturned a district judges finding that the humane society of 
the united states lacked the requisite legal standing to sue the 
interior department to stop hunting on nine federal wildlife 
preserves 
the gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting on 
wildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpses 
and environmental degradation in addition to depleting the supply 
of animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view the court 
said in an opinion written by chief judge patricia wald 
david j hayes a washington attorney who represented the humane 
society called the decision significant because it confirms that 
environmental groups like the humane society have the right to 
bring actions based on their members concerns about harms to their 
aesthetic interests 
while ruling the society had a legal right to sue the court 
upheld the interior departments decision to allow waterfowl 
hunting on chincoteague island va 
the appeals court decision sends a district court case back to 
district judge thomas a flanneryfor a ruling on the merits of the 
humane societys claims that the interior department had not 
properly evaluated the wildlife populations of other preserves 
before allowing hunting

former defense secretary caspar weinberger 
questions whether fundamental policy changes are taking place in 
the soviet union and whether mikhail gorbachev can keep his post as 
top leader 
i think we have to be very careful if we assume there are 
major policy changes weinberger said i dont know how 
firmly seated is the present regime i dont think any of us really 
know that 
im not sure anybody would be allowed to be general secretary 
of the communist party of the soviet union who is very different 
from the past weinberger told the washington foreign 
correspondents association tuesday 
weinberger who was succeeded by defense secetary frank carlucci 
late last year described as surface changes the new look at 
the kremlin gorbachev smiles from time to time he wears much 
better clothes and hes younger and apparently in better health 
than past leaders he said 
the principal change i see in the soviet union is that they 
are now actively courting world public opinion campaigning for a 
favorable world press and this is so new and so novel that they are 
getting it he said

a group of leading israeli writers 
called on the government to withdraw from the occupied territories 
and conduct direct negotiations with palestinian leaders 
i am in favor of a palestinian state alongside israel as early 
as tomorrow morning author amos oz told more than 500 people who 
gathered to protest israeli policy in the occupied lands 
i am in favor of a palestinian state because that is the 
way to life other ways lead to death 
the association of israeli playwrights organized tuesdays 
gathering which drew widely known actors singers and poets 
including several who had not previously expressed their views 
publicly on the unrest in the occupied lands 
one of them poet erez biton said that the riots in the 
occupied territories made it clear to him that through 20 years of 
israeli occupation the palestinians had become a nation 
i think this is the first time im not too mad at the 
palestinians biton said from their point of view their 
behavior is absolutely one of honor 
the disturbances which broke out dec 8 have intensified the 
controversy among israelis about what to do with the territories 
captured during the 1967 middle east war 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the rightwing likud 
bloc is against yielding any part of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip in return for peace foreign minister shimon peres head 
of the leftleaning labor party favors compromise 
both israeli leaders advocate peace talks with jordan and refuse 
to negotiate with the palestine liberation organization which is 
outlawed in israel as a terrorist group 
according to un figures the unrest has left 54 palestinians 
dead most by israeli gunfire 
the army has used live bullets then rubber ones and finally 
beatings to quell the protests israeli troops have wounded or 
severely beaten hundreds of palestinians and more than 1000 others 
been detained or jailed 
oz said the israeli crackdown on palestinian demonstrators was 
increasing hatred between arabs and israelis he predicted israels 
occupation would eventually collapse whether the two sides reach 
agreement or not 
yehoshafat harkabi a lecturer at the hebrew university said 
israelis and arabs were beginning to realize they have no choice 
but to accept one another 
the arabs have learned that if the conflict continues it will 
become hell for both israel and the arab countries said harkabi 
a former army intelligence chief both the palestinians and the 
israelis will suffer because both are in the same boat 
harkabi said israel must start negotiating right away 
the longer we wait the worse the conditions will be he 
said i realized long ago that if israel adopts a moderate policy 
we will achieve the best possible terms 
oz said peace advocates must persuade likud voters to vote for 
leftwing parties in elections scheduled for the fall 
we must try to talk seriously with the many people in israel 
who are afraid to give the west bank towns of nablus hebron and 
ramallah back to the arabs because they are afraid the arabs will 
chase us out of haifa as well oz said 
the feelings are complicated they include an element of 
genuine fear historical trauma many years of palestinian threats 
and an element of rightwing demagogy he said

hospitaized 
members of the main tamil rebel group the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam are suspected of being behind the attack a police

tigers attacked the temple because members of a rival militant 
group the peoples liberation organization of tamil eelam had 
sought refuge there

a tamil homeland since 1983 often have been blamed for attacks on 
rival groups considered to be more moderate in their demands

war to an end

it was a ballgame a prize fight a poker game 
and the always popular footrace it was high stakes make or break 
a snowslide the shoe on the other foot popcorn in a microwave 
amid a muddle of metaphors the networks struggled tuesday night 
to impress viewers with the importance of the new hampshire 
primary occasionally noting with belated cynicism that if they 
werent all there it wouldnt really mean much 
abc anchor peter jennings opened his newscast tuesday by noting 
new hampshire cant make a candidate but it certainly can break 
one 
he was seconded by jeff greenfield who described the press 
attention on the nations first presidential primary as smothering 
rather than covering and suggested one of the most interesting 
aspects of the new hampshire primary is not what we will know when 
its over but what we wont know 
vice president george bushs surprisingly strong comeback was 
the obvious lead on the democratic side losers were news 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis won as expected so the question 
became who among the remaining candidates would stay the course 
for alsorans as well as frontrunners the task tuesday night 
was putting on the best face for the national television audience 
former colorado sen gary hart who finished out of the money told 
cnns mary alice williams he had managed to find his finish in the 
low onedigits disappointing but not discouraging 
later on nbc illinois sen paul simon noted more candidly of 
his thirdplace finish this isnt helping 
dole whose alleged meanspiritedness became an issue in the 
campaign didnt help his image in greenfields piece on abc he 
was heard during a campaign stop muttering to an interloping bush 
supporter go back to your cave 
nbcs tom brokaw orchestrated the liveliest moment in the 
nights coverage with bush in the studio and dole live on a 
monitor brokaw asked bush what he would like to say to his 
opponent 
i wish him well and will see him in the south said a 
cheerful bush but when brokaw asked dole the same question he 
snapped stop lying about my record 
there were milder rematches between anchors and politicians 
rather interviewed bush live for the first time since their 
interviewturneddebate during the cbs evening news last month 
that sparked a flurry of complaints about rathers aggressive 
questioning this time rather sat quietly and let bush talk then 
happily characterized the new hampshire win as a joy and a 
jubilation for bush 
brokaw again introduced pat robertson as a former television 
evangelist a term that last week in iowa prompted robertson to 
suggest brokaw was engaging in religious bigotry robertson let 
it slide tuesday night 
cnn devoted most prime time to politics but among the other 
three networks nbc was the only one to preempt primetime 
programming for election coverage with an hourlong special at 10 
pm est 
abc wrapped up at midnight in lieu of airing nightline all 
the networks were set up in manchester nh and the candidates 
made the rounds all night but abc bagged the idea of candidate 
interviews due to the late hour of its special its brief 
primetime coverage no doubt had the biggest audience however 
since it interrupted olympics coverage 
cbs wrapped up at 1130 after devoting its regular weekly news 
documentary 48 hours to the campaign trail 
in a week when the shows format 48 hours of intense coverage 
should have been eminently adaptable to a breaking news story 
48 hours fell flat except for lesley stahls poignant coverage 
of highclass loser bruce babbitt after his poor iowa showing 
cameras caught two campaign workers embracing tearfully 
we were the best one said no one will ever know it

a grenade exploded outside a building 
housing the israeli embassy and the death toll in bloody regional 
elections in the southern philippines climbed to at least 25 
officials said today 
the military reported that communist rebels were suspected in 
the ambush of a philippine constabulary patrol tuesday in northern 
luzons mountain province eight troopers were killed and another 
10 wounded 
a constabulary report said one rebel was believed killed but his 
body was carried away by his comrades 
the military also reported that a rebel ammunition dump was 
discovered in luzons nueva ecija province it said troops 
recovered more than 4000 rounds of ammunition 132 pounds of 
explosives and 125 blasting caps 
police sgt danilo donato said an m2 grenade rigged with a 
timer exploded about 9 pm tuesday outside the philippine savings 
bank in suburban makati shattering windows but causing no injuries 
another grenade was found on the ground floor but failed to 
explode he said the building houses the israeli embassy but 
ambassador meir gavesh told the associated press he did not believe 
the embassy was the target 
we dont have any clues as to who could have possibly done 
it gavesh said 
communist rebels this month threatened to attack israeli targets 
here because of israels alleged support of the philippines 
governments antiinsurgency campaign 
israeli diplomats deny the jewish state is involved in the 
campaign against the rebels philippine and western intelligence 
sources say there are thousands of palestinians and other arabs 
living in the philippines 
in january gunmen opened fire at the french ambassador as he 
was leaving his office but he escaped injury no one has claimed 
responsibility for the attack 
meanwhile the governmentrun philippine information agency said 
at least 25 people had been killed and 50 others injured during 
clashes between rival political factions in sulu province which 
erupted three days before last mondays regional elections 
the military sent 4000 troops backed by helicopters and 
warships to the largely moslem province to guard against election 
violence sulu was the last province to hold regional elections 
which began jan 18 
in other developments an underground organization of prorebel 
priests and nuns today accused the roman catholic hierarchy of 
abandoning its mission to serve the poor by supporting president 
corazon aquinos total war policy 
by giving blessings to the total war policy of the usaquino 
regime the reactionary church leadership betrayed us all whom they 
are supposed to serve the christians for national liberation 
group said in an advertisement in the philippine daily inquirer 
due to their fear of anything red they virtually abandoned 
their flock to be fed to the hungry wolves and modern day neros 
the group said referring to the roman emperor who persecuted 
christians 
the cnl is a branch of the communistdominated national 
democratic front the statement followed recent charges by cardinal 
jaime l sin archbishop of manila that communists had infiltrated 
the churchs social welfare agency 
on tuesday defense secretary fidel ramos said harsher laws are 
needed to combat the 19yearold communist insurrection and restore 
law and order in this turbulent country 
but he said the rebellion was not at the stage where a state of 
national emergency was needed 
during his press conference ramos noted that 18 months ago he 
recommended that the government enact tougher laws to help the 
military fight the new peoples army 
his recommendations included lengthening the time suspected 
rebels could be held without charge and restoring the death penalty 
for heinous crimes such as treason and rebellion

after months of debate the us energy 
department has decided not to restart the flawed and aging n 
reactor one of four reactors supplying the us nuclear arsenal 
with bombgrade plutonium 
the n reactor has been closed since january 1987 for about 70 
million worth of safety improvements prompted by the nuclear 
disaster that killed 31 people at the similarly designed soviet 
nuclear plant at chernobyl 
energy secretary john herrington announced tuesday the reactor 
at the hanford nuclear reservation will be placed on cold 
standby status forcing about 2600 workers to be laid off in the 
next two years 
this decision signals the end of the plutonium production 
mission at the hanford site said mike lawrence hanford 
operations manager for the energy department 
plans for the mothballing of the reactor will be included in the 
reagan administrations proposed budget that will be sent to 
congress thursday 
a report prepared last year for the energy department projected 
that a gradual phaseout of plutoniumproducing operations at 
hanford by 1996 would result in the loss of more than 13800 jobs 
in the state 
gov booth gardner and members of the states congressional 
delegation pledged to seek a way to cushion the economic shock 
but sen dan evans rwash said frankly the most likely 
type of aid to come will be unemployment benefits 
herrington said the decision to mothball the reactor was based 
on a secret department of defense review of the nations future 
need for plutonium a key ingredient in nuclear weapons 
the energy department said demand for plutonium could be met by 
three reactors at the savannah river plant near aiken sc and 
through plutonium recovery from nuclear weapons retired as a result 
of the recent ussoviet treaty 
the savannah river reactors are running at 50 percent power 
because of safety concerns 
the n reactor operated for the energy department by 
westinghouse inc shares several design characteristics with the 
chernobyl plant including graphite in the reactor core to moderate 
nuclear fission and lack of a containment dome 
us officials say the n reactor operated for the energy 
department by westinghouse inc was considerably safer than the 
one at chernobyl 
the fate of the reactor the last of nine plutonium producers 
that have operated at hanford since 1944 had been mired in 
controversy proponents said the nation needed the plutonium while 
opponents contended it did not and that the reactor was unsafe 
the cold standby status will begin next year shortly after 
the safety improvements are completed and tested the reactor could 
be restarted but that would take up to three years lawrence said 
the n reactor employs 3300 of hanfords 14000 workers the 
site is the biggest employer in the nearby cities of richland 
kennewick and pasco which have a combined population of about 
130000 
state agencies will do everything they can to help those who 
will be affected by the shutdown gardner said 
rep don bonker said he and sen brock adams both democrats 
planned to introduce a military waste cleanup bill that we hope 
will provide thousands of highskilled jobs 
over 40 years of defense wastes are temporarily stored in tanks 
at the site under cold standby status fuel will be removed from 
the reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued the 
energy department said 
related plutonium processing plants which employ more than 
3000 hanford workers will be gradually phased out in the 1990s as 
the stockpiled plutonium is exhausted lawrence said 
the decision to close the reactor ended a period of uncertainty 
for local officials and plant workers 
im just glad that we finally know what the decision is 
said richland mayor john poynor well survive this and come out 
stronger for it 
the reality of it hasnt hit home yet said stan waggoner 
an n reactor technician who learned of the decision as he came off 
the afternoon shift tuesday 
hanford was built in 1943 as part of the manhattan project to 
produce atomic bombs the n reactor began operations in 1963 
at more than 4000 megawatts of thermal power the n reactor has 
the highest operating power of any us reactor

irans president told a visiting soviet 
official the united states and its allies may try to gain influence 
in afghanistan after the soviet union withdraws its troops a news 
agency reported today 
tehrans islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
said president ali khamenei met tuesday night with the soviet 
unions deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky 
during the meeting petrovsky handed khamenei a letter from 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev which touched on afghanistan and 
other issues the report said petrovsky left for home today 
ending a sixday visit to tehran 
khamenei irna reported told petrovsky that iran was pleased 
with gorbachevs policy on afghanistan and renewed a call for the 
speedy withdrawal of soviet forces from that country nine years 
after their intervention 
gorbachev issued a statement feb 8 saying the soviet union 
would begin withdrawing its 115000 troops may 15 if indirect talks 
between the pakistan and afghan governments produce an accord at 
least 60 days before that 
gorbachev also stated for the first time that a pullout would 
not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a 
transitional afghan regime which would oversee such a pullout 
irna quoted khamenei as telling petrovsky that iran was higly 
pessimistic about the us concern over afghanistan and sees no 
sincerity in its us stance therefore any plan for the 
countrys afghanistans future must prevent influence of the 
united states and its western allies the united states supports 
the moslem rebels fighting the afghan government 
irna said the two officials also discussed bilateral relations 
sovietiranian relations have been improving steadily 
especially since moscow torpedoed us efforts to impose an 
international arms embargo on iran to force it into a settlement of 
the 7yearold war with iraq 
moscow however has backed un security council resolution 
598 which was adopted unanimously last july the ceasefire 
resolution was accepted by iraq but iran insisted the baghdad 
government should be condemned as the aggressor and punished before 
any settlement of the conflict is achieved

accused of involvement in revolts that occurred last month at six 
army camps and the buenos aires metropolitan airport 
in a related development president raul alfonsin on tuesday 
told a federal judge that the rebels who briefly took over jorge 
newberry airport in downtown buenos aires on jan 18 had plans to 
assassinate him 
alfonsin in a written account to judge juan fegoli reported by 
local news agencies said investigators told him the mutineers that 
occupied the airport control tower had plans to kill him after they 
had assassinated brig gen ernesto crespo air force chief of 
staff 
crespo was en route on an airplane to the metropolitan airport 
when the group of 18 air force rebels and rightist civilians took 
over the airport crespo landed elsewhere the plan unraveled and 
the rebels surrendered without incident four hours later

staff

their roles in the uprisings remain in prison awaiting charges

attorneys for relatives of a murdered woman will 
try to convince a federal jury that an ad in the military magazine 
soldier of fortune led to her death and that the magazine should 
pay them 225 million 
robert black of bryan was sent to the texas death row for paying 
10000 to a hitman to kill his wife sandra in 1985 the alleged 
triggerman john wayne hearn is serving life terms in florida for 
other killings 
marjorie einmann mrs blacks mother and gary black the 
victims 18yearold son contend in their civil suit that an ad 
hearn placed in the denverbased publication brought him to the 
attention of robert black 
they are seeking 25 million in actual damages and 20 million 
in punitive damages from the magazine which calls itself a 
publication for professional adventurers 
our case is there was another party in this crime soldier of 
fortune ron franklin attorney for the plaintiffs said at the 
start of the trial tuesday he accused the magazine of giving black 
the means to accomplish the murder 
magazine attorney larry thompson defended the publication of the 
ad 
no one at soldier of fortune suspected anything criminal in 
that ad or any other ad in soldier of fortune we think the 
evidence will clearly show soldier of fortune was not negligent 
he said 
among questions asked prospective jurors earlier tuesday before 
a panel was selected was whether they owned a gun or had watched 
rambo and john wayne movies 
the trial could last through next week us district judge 
david hittner said 
the ad in question appeared in four issues of the magazine in 
late 1984 and sought former marine and vietnam veterans and 
weapons specialists with jungle warfare expertise for high risk 
assignments in the united states or overseas 
cbs news reported tuesday that hearn said in a court deposition 
that he had received 10 to 20 calls a day in response to the ad 
most of the callers wanted to hire him for illegal acts including 
kidnappings bombings and murder the network said 
hearn claimed he was contacted by one group to murder canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney 
from a defense perspective theres no doubt hearn and black 
met as a result of the ad thompson said but that is the only 
thin thread with regard to soldier of fortune with that ad there 
was no way for anyone to determine he was seeking criminal 
conduct 
you bet were going to win publisher robert brown said i 
have no doubt about it 
brown wearing a pinstriped suit and cowboy boots flipped 
through the pages of one his magazines while hittner took about an 
hour to review motions filed by attorneys in the case 
the suit filed 13 months ago originally sought about 100 
million in damages glenn einmann mrs blacks father recently 
and without explanation removed himself as a plaintiff 
franklin in arguments over pretrial motions said brown has 
published and run ads in the magazine for books on learning how to 
be a commando 
robert k brown says that never in his wildest dreams would he 
think that the ad would result in criminal conduct franklin 
said yet in the same issue of the magazine he has an ad for how 
to be a hitman

each had stressed goals of economic development and job creation 
in a campaign marked by few clashes but their rhetoric showed 
signs of heating up tuesday night 
schreiber promised he would tell voters how norquists campaign 
statements differed from past votes in the wisconsin senate on 
issues affecting milwaukee 
norquist asked how he differed from his opponent replied 
id be the kind of mayor that would make a decision and stick 
with it i think the city wants a strong leader 
complete unofficial returns with all 324 wards reporting gave 
schreiber 44984 votes or just over 44 percent and norquist 
40575 votes or just over 40 percent 
next were businessman and black community leader lee e holloway 
with 7885 votes or just under 8 percent and community activist 
donna horowitz richards with 5983 votes or just under 6 percent 
trailing with less than 1 percent of the vote each were willie g 
lovelace kevin j robinson and sandra sherman 
schreiber 48 joined the wisconsin senate in 1962 he served as 
lieutenant governor from 1970 until 1977 when he took over as 
acting governor after gov patrick j lucey resigned to become us 
ambassador to mexico 
he lost to republican lee s dreyfus in the 1978 election lost 
again when he sought the democratic nomination for governor in 1982 
and has worked in private business since then 
norquist 38 served in the state assembly from 197480 and was 
elected in 1982 to the senate where he has served as assistant 
democratic majority leader 
maier was first elected mayor in 1960 scoring an upset over 
us rep henry reuss he has has served as president of the us 
conference of mayors and president of the national league of cities 
black activists said they will expect the next mayor to do more 
than maier has done to help minorities

country and more than 40 percent of the citys black children live 
in poverty

latedeciding republican voters confounded the 
polls and boosted george bush to his convincing victory over sen 
bob dole in the new hampshire presidential primary analysts say 
voters who made their choice in the races final days went 
strongly for bush in part because of his superior campaign 
organization his ties to the reagan administration and his 
experience in office exit polls indicated tuesday 
the result was a 9point victory for the vice president after 
some polls had shown him leading dole just barely by 4 points in a 
cbs newsnew york times poll and 2 points in an abc newswashington 
post survey 
the voters of new hampshire have a welldeserved reputation of 
upsetting poll results and tonight was a good example of that 
said nbc news pollster laurily epstein people change their 
minds and you cant poll for that 
an nbc newswall street journal exit poll found that 14 percent 
of the gop voters in new hampshire made up their minds on primary 
day with 36 percent going for bush and 29 percent for dole 
another 11 percent decided during the weekend breaking 44 percent 
for bush to 31 percent for dole 
it was the undecideds the undecideds went for bush said 
john berrigan a poll analyst for abc news a key reason bushs 
identification with president reagan who is very popular among new 
hampshire republicans 
the reagan coattails were there said jerry strom an nbc 
news poll consultant people who like reagan were going strongly 
for bush 
nbcs exit poll supported that contention threequarters of 
republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set 
by reagan 88 percent of bushs supporters held that view compared 
with 66 percent of doles 
there were fewer reagan backers in iowa and more of them went 
for dole than for bush albeit narrowly in the precinct caucuses 
feb 8 dole won big there while bush suffered a thirdplace 
embarrassment 
berrigan said new hampshires economic vitality could explain 
reagans popularity in that state and its benefit for bush you 
may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here a belief 
that there may be a threat if i dont go with someone whos 
following the same line he said 
perhaps for similar reasons a third of republicans said 
experience was the chief factor in their vote and 54 percent of 
them voted for bush to 37 percent for dole the cbstimes poll 
said dole won among republicans looking chiefly for a strong 
leader with 48 percent to 21 percent for bush but that group made 
up just 19 percent of the gop total 
another key for bush was his extensive campaign organization in 
new hampshire the cbstimes poll found that 47 percent of bushs 
backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his 
organization while just 26 percent of doles supporters reported 
contact by the dole campaign 
i think the thing that won it for bush was his organization 
said warren mitofsky polling chief at cbs news 
while the polls did not anticipate the extent of bushs victory 
mitofsky said they did identify trends in the race bush way ahead 
before the iowa caucuses dropping sharply after losing to dole and 
pat robertson in iowa then halting his slide and rebounding during 
the weekend 
speaking on cbs bush credited his victory to a surge of support 
in the last 48 hours i learned from that fight back fight 
on he said its taught me a good lesson do not be 
discouraged by the polling numbers 
the exit poll results were less remarkable on the democratic 
side where michael dukakis won handily as expected abc had him 
winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in 
organization 
the poll results also indicated dukakis backyard advantage abc 
said 55 percent of democrats rated dukakis above average as 
governor of neighboring massachusetts and 59 percent of them voted 
for him moreover the cbstimes poll found that 20 percent of new 
hampshires democratic voters moved there from massachusetts and 
four in 10 of them went for dukakis 
rep richard gephardts secondplace finish appeared to be aided 
by his firstplace showing in iowa of the voters who made up their 
minds after iowa 27 percent went to gephardt 26 percent to 
dukakis and 20 percent to sen paul simon who finished second in 
iowa and third in new hampshire

a document purporting to announce a new 
state holiday honoring an indian chief was a forgery and state 
employees should plan to show up for work friday a spokesman for 
gov booth gardner said 
there will be no state holiday to honor indian chief leschi the 
governors press secretary dick milne said tuesday 
its a fairly elaborate scam someone is pulling here milne 
said of the bogus proclamation which bore a slightly offcenter 
state seal the governors signature is an obvious forgery he 
said 
and its definitely not true that state employees local 
government workers and school children have the day off he 
stressed 
the forged memo praises the nisqually chief the wise and 
generous leschi who was treated most unjustly to honor this 
distinguished orator and arbiter is an essential cornerstone of our 
states history 
the memo says friday is a state holiday and that when feb 19 is 
on a weekend day it will be celebrated on a friday or monday 
we havent even been asked about designating the holiday or 
even to issue a proclamation in commemoration of the day milne 
said 
besides milne said only the legislature has the authority to 
proclaim a state holiday 
the governors office has no idea who forged the document milne 
said adding that the culprit had a good knowledge of indian 
history

minority students occupying a university 
of massachusetts building remained today after they failed to agree 
on an understanding reached by their negotiators and college 
officials 
im not disappointed im tired weve been going at this a 
long time dwayne warren a spokesman for the group said at a 4 
am news conference announcing the deadlock 
two women wept in the halls of the new africa house after about 
100 protesters debated for five hours on the administrations 
response to their eight demands 
the demands included suspending five white students accused of 
beating two blacks feb 7 and suspending campus police officers 
accused of forming a lineup of blacks the same night in their 
search for men who allegedly harassed women on campus 
the students want immediate action but the way the structure 
is set up you cant get that said a student negotiator david 
moore 
moore said the protesters planned to continue the debate at noon 
today in the building they have closed to whites since friday 
all but one of the nine student negotiators were pleased with 
the understanding reached with university chancellor joseph duffey 
after four hours of talks tuesday 
not all the demands have been met but all have been responded 
to in good faith duffey said as he forwarded a written statement 
to the students at 1030 pm tuesday there are things i cannot 
do now but weve agreed to plan to address general concerns 
but the mood quickly changed when the demands and duffeys 
response went before the 100 students occupying the building late 
tuesday 
the vote is going very slowly and is being met with mixed 
emotions roscoe robinson another spokesman for the protesters 
reported as the debate wore on 
warren had said the students were prepared to take over another 
building if they failed to reach an agreement with university 
officials 
after the deadlock however he ruled it out at this point 
its too radical an approach he said 
he declined to give details about the debate except to say that 
students felt duffeys response to their demands was vague 
administrators did not release the document sent to the 
students but warren said it contained a promise of efforts to 
improve minority students conditions and increase financing of 
minority programs 
more than 500 white umass students rallied tuesday to support 
the occupation 
hey ho chancellor joe racism has got to go white 
supporters chanted as duffey made his way to the building 
students and faculty members also read letters of support at the 
rally including a message from democratic presidential candidate 
jesse jackson 
the students occupying the new africa house have taken a 
principled position on legitimate concerns jackson said in his 
statement the quality of leadership in the state and country can 
be determined by how it handles such crises as this one 
the university moved classes that usually meet in new africa 
house and officials have said they do not intend to force the 
students out of the building 
about 9 percent of the 25000 students at the states largest 
public university are minorities including 641 blacks 
last year the university disciplined six white students who 
pleaded no contest to charges stemming from a campus racial clash 
in which a black student was beaten after the final 1986 world 
series game between the boston red sox and the new york mets

the soviet union has started dismantling some of 
its missiles in east germany although a superpower treaty scrapping 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles has not been ratified a news 
agency reported 
adn east germanys staterun news agency said missiles 
stationed in waren 20 miles west of neubrandenburg have been 
taken apart put in crates and are ready for transport back to the 
soviet union 
with this step we can make an important contribution toward 
disarmament even before the treaty between the united states and 
the soviet union is ratified adn said tuesday night 
the communist party daily newspaper neues deutschland today 
printed a frontpage report on the preparations for early removal 
of the missiles neubrandenburg is north of berlin 
soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the ddr east 
germany troops in waren dismantle rockets earlier than 
expected neues deutschland new germany said in a headline to 
its story 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed 
the treaty in washington last december agreeing to eliminate all 
landbased medium and shorterrange missiles 
the agreement stipulates that the soviets shorterrange 
missiles in east germany and in czechoslovakia are to be removed 
within 18 months and mediumrange us and soviet missiles within 
three years 
the senate has not ratified the treaty the supreme soviet the 
soviet unions parliament is expected to approve the accord 
in washington the state department had no immediate reaction to 
the report 
a us official however said the soviets were free to take 
down their missiles before the treaty takes effect the official 
who demanded anonymity said us inspectors will go to east 
germany and all other soviet missile sites to verify the soviets 
were complying with the treaty if it is ratified 
although there was no comment in moscow on the reported 
dismantling gorbachev on tuesday criticized western european 
countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the 
superpower treaty 
the official tass news agency quoted gorbachev as criticizing 
western european governments for the latest wave of praise for 
the nuclear deterrence strategy all manner of projects for 
the joint manufacture of newest weapons the francowest german 
military rapprochement and so forth 
west german government officials declined comment on the report 
tuesday night it is too early for us to comment at this time 
a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
the associated press 
adn did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when 
they would be returned to the soviet union only that soviet 
soldiers are making the last preparations to return their ss12 
rockets 
the rockets are shorterrange weapons included in the 
intermediaterange missile treaty which bans weapons with a range 
of 300 miles to 3000 miles 
east german television late tuesday showed soldiers loading 
missile crates onto transport vehicles

very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit the 
rockets are to be sent back to the soviet union by train adn said 
it said east german journalists who toured the missile base were 
allowed to interview soviet soldiers 
erich honecker the east german leader indicated in january

american labor leaders are breaking a 
fourdecade tradition of unqualified support for israel condemning 
its use of unneccessary force against palestinians on the west 
bank and in gaza 
the 143millionmember labor federations executive council 
approved the firstever rebuke of israel tuesday after meeting with 
secretary of state george shultz who is scheduled to begin a tour 
of the middle east next week 
the aflcios winter meeting was shultz last stop of an 
extended weekend in southern florida to gain support from 
traditional friends of israel for his effort to soften israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs opposition to entering new peace 
negotiations 
shultz is seeking to promote a resumption of negotiations on 
palestinian selfrule in the israelioccupied territories 
shultz addressed a meeting of the bnai brith antidefamation 
league in palm beach last friday seeking help from us jewish 
leaders in pressing shamir to show more flexibility 
theres been so much emphasis on the process direct 
negotiations on the one hand an international conference or some 
kind of international vehicle on the other that the discussion 
has become a little sterile he told reporters tuesday if we 
are going to get going we need to talk a little bit more about the 
substance of what might happen 
shamir has opposed a resumption of negotiations if they are 
based on a premise that israel will have to give up state control 
of some of the occupied territories as a condition for peace 
shultz said the united states is not trying to stake out a 
position of one kind or another on that issue however he said 
getting to the substance in terms of things that would be 
talked about when people address ultimate resolutions of the 
arabisraeli conflict is needed to get the negotiations going 
again 
the aflcio while blaming islamic fundamentalists for fueling 
the flames of violence in the occupied territories said the 
palestinian demonstrations did not warrant the unnecessary 
force used by israeli defense forces on occasion 
no doubt such incidents can be attributed to the inexperience 
of the israeli army in riot control and other police functions and 
to the frustrations of israeli soldiers as they confront young 
palestinians hurling stones and petrol bombs the federation 
said these factors may explain but they cannot excuse and the 
aflcio cannot condone the use of excessive force against 
civilians 
the federation however rejected what it called a notion that 
israel must now redeem itself by turning the west bank and gaza 
strip over to the palestine liberation organization

us secretary of state george p shultzs 
forthcoming middle east tour will fail to advance arabisraeli 
peace efforts because of washingtons flirtation with israel a 
leading columnist said today 
moussa sabry also blamed american influence and zionist 
israeli terrorism for wrecking a plan by the palestine 
liberation organization to send a ship on a protest voyage from 
nicosia to israel this week 
shultz is to make the regional tour late this month to discuss a 
reported us peace plan 
the blueprint according to reports from washington and 
jerusalem calls for an international forum to launch arabisraeli 
talks in april on interim palestinian selfrule in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza negotiations on a final 
settlement for the two territories would open in december 
the plan was reported to have been outlined in a recent area 
tour by assistant secretary of state richard murphy 
i am not convinced that the us administration under ronald 
reagan will move effectively as a partner in the peace process 
sabry wrote its all very well to make tours of capitals in the 
area its all very well for murphy or shultz to come to the 
region but these trips will bring no results 
sabry one of a group of egyptian journalists known to be close 
to president hosni mubarak was writing in his periodic column on 
the front page of the stateowned newspaper alakhbar he often is 
critical of israel but his comments about the united states were 
harsher than usual 
citing next novembers us presidential election he wrote 
this is the year when democratic and republican candidates vie 
for the jewish vote this is when the flirtation with israel heats 
up i even venture the belief that the object of the us 
administrations flirtation is israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir the leader of extremism 
sabry appeared to imply that washington prefers shamir to his 
moderate coalition cabinet partner foreign minister shimon peres 
whose labor party favors territorial concessions to the arabs 
on the plo ship sabry said american influence and zionist 
terrorism that tried to destroy the vessel were the reason why 
the planned protest voyage to israel has been stalled 
the plo charged that israeli agents planted a mine that blew a 
hole and crippled the cypriot ferry sol phryne on monday as it was 
being readied to carry palestinian deportees international 
observers and reporters to israel 
israel vowed to prevent the ship from entering its waters

israeli soldiers opened fire 
on palestinian demonstrators in a west bank village today killing 
one with a shot through the heart and wounding four others arab 
reports and hospital officials said 
the army confirmed that soldiers fatally shot one arab and 
wounded four in clashes in the village of shuyukh northeast of the 
city of hebron 
two officers opened fire after more than 100 shuyukh residents 
attacked an army patrol with stones and bottles said an officer in 
shuyukh he spoke on condition of anonymity 
also today the norwegian ambassador apologized to israeli 
officials for saying the conduct of israeli troops in the occupied 
territories was worse than that of german troops who occupied 
norway during world war ii 
ambassador torleiv anda apologized after he was summoned to the 
foreign ministry and met with the ministrys political 
directorgeneral yossi beilin 
doctors at alia hospital in hebron said a 25yearold shuyukh 
resident was killed by a shot that pierced the heart the palestine 
press service identified him as ismail mohammed hussein 
alia doctors also said they treated four shuyukh residents for 
gunshot wounds in the legs and arms and four women for beating 
injuries 
one of the wounded khaled abu rumei told the associated press 
from his hospital bed that soldiers had entered the village at 
about 5 am to round up suspected agitators 
they started breaking into houses and taking people away 
said rumeis mother who would not give her first name she said 
soldiers clubbed her when she tried to stop them from detaining one 
of her sons 
the army declared the village a closed military area and 
soldiers turned back reporters who went to the scene in early 
afternoon 
the army meanwhile clamped a curfew on the nearby village of 
sair the site of frequent antiisraeli protests the army official 
said he said soldiers detained several residents but did not have 
further details 
during the meeting with the norwegian ambssador beilin 
expressed his sharp protest to anda said foreign ministry 
spokesman ehud gol 
the ambassador expressed regret that his words were understood 
in a way which has caused embarrassment gol said 
anda told israel radio after the meeting that there was a 
misunderstanding that i wanted to compare these two regimes and 
im very happy to have the opportunity to clarify 
anda told reporters tuesday that many norwegians were comparing 
the conduct of the israeli army to the behavior of nazi troops who 
occupied norway for five years during world war ii 
what the germans did including beating and torturing 
prisoners and suspects was very bad the jerusalem post 
newspaper quoted anda as saying but we do not remember them 
going out into the streets to break peoples arms and legs or 
pulling children out of their homes at night 
the army today said seven palestinians were wounded late tuesday 
in clashes at the fawwar refugee camp south of hebron aliya 
hospital officials said that in addition to gunshot victims they 
treated 12 arabs who were injured by rubber bullets or beatings 
also tuesday soldiers shot and wounded two palestinians in the 
west bank village of kabatiyeh and a third in the nearby city of 
jenin hospital officials said the army confirmed one protester 
was wounded in kabatiyeh 
in another development transport minister chaim corfu hinted 
israel was involved in bombing the ferry that was to carry 130 
deported palestinians back to israel the palestine liberation 
organization which sponsored the voyage has accused israel of 
responsibility for the bombing monday at the port of limassol 
cyprus 
corfu warned that if the plo bought another ship for the trip 
its fate will be the same 
speaking on israel radio tuesday corfu said we knew we 
wouldnt allow the boat to reach israel if we could prevent its 
departure that was obviously the right thing to do 
in parliament tuesday defense minister yitzhak rabin was 
questioned about his policy of beating palestinians to stop riots 
he said the beating orders were necessary and to the best of my 
knowledge and judgment are legal 
rabin said soldiers have exceeded orders in many cases and 
confirmed troops used a bulldozer earlier this month to bury alive 
four arabs near nablus the arabs were saved by other palestinians 
maj gen ehud barak deputy chief of staff said a 
sergeantmajor and a noncommissioned officer were detained in 
connection with the incident 
barak said soldiers had no choice but to use beatings to try to 
curb nearly 2 months of riots in the occupied lands 
he said more than 200 israelis had been injured most of them 
lightly and that 53 arabs had been killed since disturbances began 
dec 8 the united nations puts the death toll at 54

sen paul simon said today that unless 
he wins in either minnesota or south dakota next tuesday he will 
drop out of the race for president 
im having a press conference where im going to say i 
have to win in either minnesota or south dakota receive additional 
funding from small donors or im going to have to withdraw from 
the race simon said on abcs good morning america 
simon said his thirdplace finish in new hampshire was 
strong but added that he cant indefinitely come in second 
and third 
we have a good base in minnesota and south dakota i think 
we have a real shot at one or both of those states he said 
minnesota holds caucuses next tuesday while south dakotans go to 
the polls in a primary election 
simon said earlier that while finishing behind new hampshire 
democratic winner michael dukakis and secondplace richard gephardt 
wasnt what he had hoped for he will not change the focus of his 
campaign 
no absolutely not the illinois democrat said as he edged 
out of his election night headquarters amid a swarm of reporters 
and cameras the message has to be the same thats what i 
believe 
speaking earlier to supporters gathered at a restaurant he 
vowed to be the advocate for a nation that once more cares for 
working men and women that fights for the less fortunate that 
stands up for middleclass americans who want to send their 
children to college that reaches out to build a world that is 
safer for our children and generations to come 
simons national campaign spokesman attempted to put the best 
face on the thirdplace showing maintaining that the candidate 
turned conventional wisdom topsyturvy even before the new 
hampshire vote 
spokesman terry michael said simon was able to blunt gephardts 
momentum coming out of iowa and that new hampshire was a lock for 
dukakis 
simon has acknowledged that finances are a problem for his 
campaign and he had hoped for a secondplace showing in new 
hampshire to aid in fundraising 
michael said the simon campaign had debts of about 500000 
with about 200000 on hand but expected to raise another 300000 
to 400000 this week 
simon after congratulating his backers for their efforts urged 
them not to give up 
you have not been campaigning just for some fellow wearing a 
bow tie he said you have been campaigning for a cause 
simon was accompanied on a makeshift stage by his wife jeanne 
and other supporters when it partially collapsed as he began his 
remarks 
recovering quickly simon joked believe it or not the 
platform i stand on is a bit solider

michael dukakis and richard gephardt 
looking south after their onetwo finish in new hampshires 
democratic primary said today that campaign themes should not 
change with the region paul simon said he would withdraw from the 
race unless he wins one of two contests next week 
people in the south arent voting for a zip code theyre 
voting for the president of the united states dukakis the 
massachusetts governor said on abcs good morning america 
gephardt appearing on the same program characterized his 
second place finish in new hampshire as a victory the reason we 
won he said is because we got off the plane last week and 
began saying the same thing in new hampshire that we said in iowa 
dukakis said the race still was wide open gephardt said it 
had now come down to him and dukakis 
meanwhile simon who came in third said i have to win 
either in south dakota or minnesota otherwise im going to have to 
withdraw 
dukakis the threeterm governor of nextdoor massachusetts won 
tuesdays primary with a strong 17percentage point margin over the 
missouri congressman he was leaving today for the next major 
battleground the south 
even as he did however dukakis acknowledged that his victory 
didnt decide the race but drew the battle lines more clearly i 
think its going to go all the way to the last primary he said 
gephardt whose victory in iowas caucuses eight days earlier 
was largely overshadowed by the brawl on the republican side 
accomplished his chief aim finishing ahead of fellow midwesterner 
simon 
i love new hampshire gephardt said 
its a result that we needed here gephardt said it 
appears to be that weve got a dukakisgephardt race in the rest of 
the country but that could change 
dukakis won 37 percent of the vote and said the victory gives 
him momentum heading into the delegaterich primaries on march 8 
when contests are set in every state of the south but one 
the massachusetts governor won nearly as many votes as his next 
two closest challengers combined and he was leaving immediately 
for the next round of campaigning in atlanta and florida 
last week in iowa our message started to shine through and we 
won a bronze he said a reference to his thirdplace finish in 
that states caucuses tonight here in new hampshire our message 
came through loud and clear we went for the gold and we won it 
gephardt had 20 percent and simon the illinois senator had 17 
percent 
jesse jacksons 8 percent put him in fourth place ahead of 
tennessean albert gore jrs 7 percent bruce babbitt finished with 
just 5 percent and headed for washington to meet with advisers and 
wrestle with the question of whether to withdraw 
finishing last with 4 percent was gary hart the prohibitive 
frontrunner a year ago who saw his presidential hopes wrecked with 
embarrassing disclosures about his personal life 
when he reentered the race in middecember hart said let 
the people decide and in new hampshire their decision wasnt the 
one he wanted he said it would take 30 to 60 days to determine 
if i can put together a viable candidacy and suggested he may 
scale back the scope of his effort 
its a disappointing showing but were not discouraged hart 
said 
gephardt was leaving new hampshire before dawn for stops in 
south dakota and wyoming both of which have contests in the next 
three weeks 
gephardt was betting on gaining a boost in south dakota and 
planned to be in that small state six out of the next seven days 
even though its primary next tuesday is a beauty contest where 
voters express a preference but dont award nominating delegates 
he came into new hampshire saddled with debt as was simon both 
face the prospect of a threeweek campaign where the costs of 
buying television airtime across the south are enormous and where 
they may be forced to select states to contest while bypassing 
others 
were not badly in debt gephardt said were in good 
shape money is coming in 
gores fifthplace finish wasnt good enough to give him any 
boost going into the south as he had hoped gore spent a lot of 
money in new hampshire but not a lot of time and he departed the 
state for much of the final week while his competitors dominated 
the airwaves 
simon was heading to minnesota which like south dakota has its 
contest next tuesday and where he must do well to stay in the race 
simon had predicted he would beat gephardt and challenge dukakis 
in new hampshire but he insisted were moving on 
jackson and gore both of whom have an enormous stake in the 
super tuesday primaries across the south were campaigning there 
today jackson was heading to florida and gore watched the returns 
from texas 
all the candidates were converging on texas where the first of 
a series of southern debates is set for thursday night in dallas 
the republicans debate there on friday 
although the first primary of the 1988 campaign was likely to 
winnow the field none of the losers displayed a willingness to 
leave the race right away the most likely candidate appeared to be 
babbitt and jackson said he talked with babbitt about gaining an 
endorsement if the former arizona governor quits the race 
no way babbitt insisted when asked if he would withdraw 
but he said he planned meetings with supporters to ask should i 
wage a guerrilla campaign or should i withdraw and do something 
else 
although far more was at stake in new hampshire 18 nominating 
delegates were awarded by the primary results dukakis collected 9 
gephardt 6 and simon 3 
the rest got none

east german newspapers today printed pictures of 
dismantled missiles and hailed soviet preparations for removing 
ss12 nuclear missiles before a superpower treaty scrapping 
intermediaterange weapons is ratified 
in the name of reason a historic moment awaits said a 
banner headline in the junge welt young world the communist 
partys youth newspaper 
soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the ddr east 
germany troops in waren dismantle mediumrange rockets earlier 
than expected neues deutschland new germany said in a headline 
waren is 20 miles west of neubrandenburg and about 90 miles 
north of berlin 
removal of missile troops starts earlier than expected 
transfer to the soviet union and destruction of their type ss12 
armaments in the ussr the east berlin daily berliner zeitung 
said 
east germanys staterun news agency adn said tuesday night that 
missiles in waren had been taken apart put in crates and were 
ready for transport back to the soviet union 
with this step we can make an important contribution toward 
disarmament even before the treaty between the united states and 
the soviet union is ratified adn said 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed 
the treaty in washington last december agreeing to eliminate all 
landbased medium and shorterrange missiles 
the agreement stipulates that the soviets shorterrange 
missiles in east germany and in czechoslovakia are to be removed 
within 18 months and mediumrange us and soviet missiles within 
three years 
the senate has not ratified the treaty the supreme soviet the 
soviet unions parliament is expected to approve the accord 
in washington the state department had no immediate reaction to 
the report 
a us official however said the soviets were free to take 
down their missiles before the treaty takes effect the official 
who demanded anonymity said us inspectors will go to east 
germany and all other soviet missile sites to verify the soviets 
were complying with the treaty if it is ratified 
although there was no comment in moscow on the reported 
dismantling gorbachev on tuesday criticized western european 
countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the 
superpower treaty 
the official tass news agency quoted gorbachev as criticizing 
western european governments for the latest wave of praise for 
the nuclear deterrence strategy all manner of projects for 
the joint manufacture of newest weapons the francowest german 
military rapprochement and so forth 
west german government officials declined comment on the report 
tuesday night it is too early for us to comment at this time 
a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
the associated press 
adn did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when 
they would be returned to the soviet union only that soviet 
soldiers are making the last preparations to return their ss12 
rockets 
the rockets are shorterrange weapons included in the 
intermediaterange missile treaty which bans weapons with a range 
of 300 miles to 3000 miles 
east german television late tuesday showed soldiers loading 
missile crates onto transport vehicles 
adn quoted a soviet military officer as saying the troops are 
very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit the 
rockets are to be sent back to the soviet union by train adn said 
it said east german journalists who toured the missile base were 
allowed to interview soviet soldiers 
erich honecker the east german leader indicated in january 
that soviet intermediaterange rockets stationed in east germany 
could be removed ahead of schedule but he gave no specific 
timetable 
according to figures released after the treaty was signed 22 
rockets 12 launchers nine transport vehicles and seven practice 
missiles were stationed at the neubrandenburg site which holds the 
largest numbers of ss12s in east germany there are three other 
ss12 rocket sites in east germany 
in all there are 54 ss12s in east germany according to those 
figures 
the soviet union also has 53 ss23 shorterrange nuclear rockets 
in east germany

legislation prohibiting local governments from 
promoting homosexuality is virtually certain to become law after 
the house of lords defeated an amendment that would have limited 
the measure to stateowned schools 
the lords the unelected upper chamber of parliament voted 
9048 on tuesday night to defeat the amendment 
the restriction on promoting homosexuality is included in a 
legislative package proposed by prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative administration 
the vote represented the legislations last parliamentary hurdle 
and the package has been penciled in for entry onto the statute 
books on june 1 the package only needs to complete a formal final 
reading in parliament for it to become law 
the bill stipulate that local authorities which run public 
libraries some theaters and most state schools must not 
intentionally promote homosexuality authorities that defy the 
ban can be sued by individuals or penalized by auditors for 
misusing funds according to the legislation 
the amendment defeated by the house of lords sought to limit the 
ban on promoting homosexuality to one area only stateowned 
schools 
a labor party member lord willis also tried to include wording 
saying the proposed law is not a license to discriminate against 
homosexuals but his effort failed when the time allotted for 
debate ran out 
arguing for the measure home office minister lord caithness 
said gay pride programs and the promotion of gay rights in 
youth clubs run by some local authorities sought to glamorize 
homosexuality 
young people are susceptible to these intolerable influences 
activities such as a lesbian gay strength and pride week are in 
the governments view at least as likely to glamorize 
homosexuality in the minds of impressionable young people as 
anything a teacher might do he said 
lord longford of the socialist opposition labor party told the 
house of lords the measure smacked of a general queerbashing 
campaign 
mrs thatcher complained last fall that children were being 
taught they have an inalienable right to be gay her government 
has accused some leftwing local authorities of using state funds 
to promote homosexuality 
leftist local governments including those running inner city 
london and the northern cities of manchester and sheffield have 
been criticized by conservative newspapers in britain for giving 
grants to gay and lesbian community groups 
the government also has acted to curb spending by local 
authorities and plans shortly to introduce controls on what is 
taught in stateowned schools whose daytoday running is in the 
hands of local government 
critics said the homosexuality measure known as clause 28 was 
a setback for gay rights in britain and a swing toward 
authoritanian rule by mrs thatcher and her government walls in 
london and other cities were covered with slogans attacking clause 
28 as repressive legislation 
some critics of the measure also said the word promote is so 
vague it could allow local authorities to censor works by em 
forster and other famous homosexual writers in public libraries and 
theaters 
the government has denied prejudice and dismissed that criticism 
homosexual acts in private between consenting civilian males who 
are at least 21 years old were legalized by the sexual offenses act 
in 1967 although the age limit is widely ignored by britains gay 
community 
homosexuality between males in the armed forces is outlawed 
for centuries until 1836 the death penalty was used to deter 
sodomy in britain until 1967 it was punishable by imprisonment 
oscar wilde the homosexual irishborn playwright was sentenced 
to two years imprisonment with hard labor in 1895 and until the 
passing of the 1967 act male homosexuals lived in constant fear of 
blackmail the 1967 act referred only to males as british law has 
never banned lesbianism

sen albert gore jr of tennessee said today that 
while he was concentrating on the south his presidential rivals 
picked up harmful political baggage by taking narrow positions 
while campaigning in other parts of the nation 
they all came out for mandatory controls on agricultural 
products that would be a disaster in the south gore said on 
cbs this morning 
overall gore says he has no regrets about skipping the iowa 
caucuses and new hampshire primary because there was no point in 
spending 1 million on two or three delegates 
were saving that for the 1400 delegates here in the super 
tuesday states gore said tuesday night after meeting with a 
group of about 20 houston businessmen including former texas gov 
mark white 
gore maintained his focus on southern states involved in next 
months super tuesday primaries while most presidential candidates 
were in new hampshire awaiting results of that states leadoff 
primary 
we made a decision not to spend 1 million on two or three 
delegates gore said 
gore campaigned little in new hampshire and finished fifth in 
the democratic race there with about 7 percent of the votes he 
said that was better than he expected but the big test is yet to 
come 
super tuesday changes all the rules gore said i think 
what weve seen were some rather inconclusive results in iowa and 
the fact that the iowa momentum did not have much of an impact on 
new hampshire indicates that super tuesday is a completely new ball 
game 
he said the candidates involved in iowa and new hampshire are 
bringing to texas and other super tuesday states a set of positions 
on issues that are not in touch with mainstream voters 
gores campaign already has started television commercials in 
major markets in texas as well as national advertisements on cable 
network news and cabledistributed wtbs in chicago

augsburg college officials have changed their 
minds about naming part of a new building after a major donor 
because they learned he had mailed thousands of hostile letters to 
interracial families 
the college will however keep the 500000 elroy stock donated 
last year as well as other contributions made over 20 years 
the positions and actions of mr elroy stock as reported in 
the media have disturbed angered and saddened hundreds of 
individuals and families including members of the augsburg 
community college president charles anderson said tuesday after 
a regents committee meeting 
for some persons to have the name of mr stock on a wing of 
our new building would be misunderstood to mean the college agrees 
with his stance anderson said 
anderson who is white and has a black daughterinlaw said he 
received three anonymous letters himself from stock 
stock a 65yearold retired executive of west publishing co 
who lives in woodbury gave the lutheren college 500000 for a new 
worship drama and communication building it was the largest 
single gift last year to the college which has 2100 students 
mr stocks way of acquiring the funds is through honest 
work anderson said whatever mr stock has done he has had an 
opportunity to use his means to do some good for a lot of people i 
see no reason why he should be denied that opportunity 
stock a 1949 augsburg graduate told wccotv on tuesday that he 
was disappointed by the decision not to name the building wing 
after him 
its all over he said i dont want to even think about 
it if they want to take it off im not going to care 
wccotv reported last week that stock had been sending unsigned 
letters to interracial couples for 14 years the station said the 
letters included such comments as a dog breeder would not think 
of producing mongrel dogs so why should the human race be 
mongrel 
anderson said he was convinced after meeting with stock over the 
weekend that stock is sorry he hurt people with the mailings 
after a fiveyear investigation postal officials linked the 
letters to stock in early 1987 said sterling mckusick a retired 
us postal service inspector mckusick had received about 1000 
complaints the earliest dating to about 1982 
but stock could not be prosecuted because he had not broken any 
laws complaints ceased shortly after stock was confronted by 
authorities in march 1987 mckusick said 
anderson said no one at the college was aware of the situation 
until school officials were contacted by wcco

bob dole beaten back by george bush in the 
new hampshire republican primary today renewed his allegations 
that the vice president had distorted his record and promised to 
counterattack while jack kemp said he could unite the gops 
conservative wing 
from top to bottom the 1988 republican presidential race was as 
hot and furious after the new hampshire primary as it had been 
before no one talked of withdrawal and all looked south for new 
battles 
for his part bush denied that his campaign had distorted doles 
record 
im sorry he feels that way the vice president said in an 
interview aired today on cbs 
interviewed on abcs good morning america dole said the 
bush camp first tried character assassination in iowa 
that didnt work he said so they start on distorting 
your record unless they want to get back on the straight and 
narrow and withdraw some of their attacks were going to have to 
counterattack 
kemp said that although he finished third overall in new 
hampshires gop contest he was first among the conservatives and 
he said he could bridge the gap between the conservative wing 
and pat robertsons evangelical christian wing 
kemp was crowing because he finished ahead of former delaware 
gov pete du pont and robertson a former television evangelist a 
week ago he finished a weak fourth in iowa while robertson was 
second 
in the firstinthenation balloting here were the numbers at 
the end of the counting bush 39 percent and dole 29 percent 
kemp had 13 percent du pont 10 percent and robertson 10 
percent 
alexander haig who dropped out of the race friday got less 
than 1 percent 
bush dole and kemp were slated to be in washington today while 
du pont headed for wilmington del 
robertson was campaigning in south carolina and florida two 
southern states where he hopes to win a few primaries early next 
month 
tomorrow morning we go into the south and theyre going to be 
playing in my backyard robertson said im throwing the 
gauntlet down to bob dole and george bush south carolina is the 
first super tuesday state and im going to beat you there 
convincingly 
south carolina holds a republican primary on march 5 three days 
before the super tuesday megaprimary on march 8 
du pont who won the endorsement of the union leader of 
manchester but did not turn that into a victory vowed to press on 
im going southwithout question he said we did much 
better in new hampshire than we did in iowa well do much better 
in the south than we did in new hampshirethe point is weve all 
finished together probably within a half point of each other 
bush expressed heartfelt thanks to new hampshire republicans 
whom he told a week ago im one of you 
thank you new hampshire bush said on to the south 
where were going to rise again 
the battling to get into place for super tuesday when 16 
states will hold republican events began even before the tally 
was finished in the granite state 
dole was being interviewed by nbcs tom brokaw when the 
anchorman turned and asked if dole had anything to say to bush 
yeah quit lying about my record dole said testily 
dole said bushs ads that claimed dole wants to raise taxes just 
arent true 
i dont mind being attacked on my record when we have a 
difference but to just right out flat out distort the record 
then i think we need to call attention to that dole said its 
unfortunate that the vice president of the united states who knows 
better would sink to that level 
asked later about the dole remark bush said i dont know 
what hes talking about 
if it hadnt been for the distortion of my positions on tax 
increases and an oil import fee id be 10 points ahead dole 
added 
dole had been riding a wave out of his iowa win a week ago 
monday rising to as much as an eightpoint lead over bush in some 
overnight polls 
but bush and his campaign did an aboutface in the middle of the 
week dropping the formal campaign style launching the attacks on 
doles record and talking a lot about himself and his own feelings 
bush was also helped by president reagans popularity in new 
hampshire in iowa where the administration is blamed for economic 
woes his white house tie was a liability 
and at the end of the week bush brought in conservative hero 
barry goldwater to polish his conservative credentials and he 
stood on the stage with baseball hero ted williams adding a 
celebrity sheen in a state that watched williams perform miracles 
for the boston red sox

a man who first said strong winds blew his 
bride off a cruise ship now claims israeli secret agents killed his 
wife in retribution for a book he wrote about human rights abuses 
scott robin roston 36 who is being held for investigation of 
murdering his wife 26yearold karen waltz roston made the 
allegation tuesday in a statement released by his lawyer after an 
appearance in federal court 
meanwhile the san diego county coroners office said mrs 
roston died from strangulation associated with drowning which 
was determined to be a homicide 
doctors performing the autopsy found contusions on mrs rostons 
neck as well as other signs she had been in a struggle according 
to an fbi affidavit filed in us district court 
roston initially had said his wife had been blown overboard by 
wind while jogging saturday aboard the star dancer as it returned 
to los angeles from their honeymoon cruise 
the ships captain thomas wildung said winds were light 
in his new statement roston claimed the agents drugged him 
leaving him with no memory of that night 
he said israeli agents had tried unsuccessfully to kidnap him in 
the past and that us agents also had pursued him because he held 
documents showing us government involvement in what he called 
israels gross violation of human rights 
he feels that this murder is the result of a book he published 
last year in new york city in which he exposed the numerous human 
rights abuses which he perceived in israel said rostons 
attorney paul potter 
potter said he would seek a psychiatric examination of his 
client and added that roston may have received a psychiatric 
discharge from the navy 
calls to the israeli consulate in los angeles were referred to 
an official who was out of town and unavailable for comment 
at a detention hearing tuesday roston was ordered by us 
magistrate john r kronenberg to remain in custody at terminal 
island federal prison without bail said mary mcmenimen 
spokeswoman for the us attorneys office his next court date was 
scheduled for march 8 
mrs rostons body was found saturday floating in the pacific 
ocean 44 miles southwest of san diego it was taken to san diego 
while the star dancer owned by admiral cruises of miami continued 
on to los angeles 
roston who had moved to santa monica in june from lantana 
fla was questioned by fbi agents upon arrival in los angeles and 
later arrested 
books in print lists scott robin roston as the author of 
nightmare in israel published in 1987 by vantage press a 
vanity publishing house in which authors pay for the publication of 
their works 
the rostons were married feb 4 in las vegas nev and shortly 
afterward embarked on the mexican cruise they won in a contest 
rostons father said 
meanwhile the head of the california chiropractors association 
said roston who has been identified as a chiropractor by his 
mother and roommate is not licensed to practice either in 
california or florida

the federal aviation administration wants all 
aircraft operating near 254 of the nations airports to have 
devices that automatically inform air traffic controllers of a 
planes altitude 
the devices called mode c transponders are already required on 
commercial aircraft the regulation proposed tuesday would affect 
private planes operating within 40 miles of the designated airports 
the regulation would also require all aircraft operating at 
6000 feet or move above the surface in controlled airspace to 
carry the transponders 
faa administrator allan mcartor said increased use of the 
devices would ease the burden on controllers and reduce the 
potential for collisions and close encounters between planes 
by taking advantage of the existing aviation technology this 
rule if adopted will provide a significant enhancement to the 
safety of our nations flying public mcartor said 
the proposed rule would implement legislation passed by congress 
to require expanded use of the transponders 
the faa now requires the transponders for aircraft operating at 
12500 feet or more above sea level and in socalled terminal 
control areas around the nations 23busiest airports last june 
the agency proposed a rule requiring mode c transponders for 
aircraft operating within 30 miles of such airports 
the faa said increased use of the transponders allows the 
display of altitude information on an air traffic controllers 
radar screen can warn controllers of possible conflicts provide 
lowaltitude warnings and activate a collisionavoidance system in 
aircraft that have such a system 
the proposed rule will be open to public comment through march

republican jack kemp armed with a 
thirdplace new hampshire finish ahead of pat robertson predicted 
today that he would continue to do well against his fellow 
conservative in the southern primaries 
robertson is certainly a conservative but a rather negative 
conservative kemp said i dont think pat robertson can 
ultimately be the candidate of the conservative south 
kemp interviewed on abctvs good morning america 
celebrated his finish ahead of former delaware gov pete du pont 
and robertson as a victory in a race for the conservatives in 
the republican party 
he said that race was separate from the race for the 
traditional moderate wing of the party between vice president 
george bush and senate republican leader bob dole 
id like george and bob to withdraw he added wryly 
final unofficial results from tuesdays firstinthenation 
primary gave kemp 13 percent of the vote placing him behind bush 
who had 38 percent and dole at 29 percent du pont and robertson 
each received 10 percent with du pont slightly ahead 
the new york congressman called the results a victory 
particularly after robertsons surprise secondplace finish in the 
iowa caucuses 
theres two contests in this party kemp his family at his 
side told about 400 supporters at a hotel ballroom bedecked with 
red white and blue balloons 
theres the contest for the establishment wing of the 
republican party and there is a contest for the conservative wing 
we won the contest for the conservative wing 
and the thing thats happening now and you can feel it right 
here in new hampshire finally weve dragged bush and dole out of 
discussing their resumes and their tax returns and where theyre 
born and into discussing issues 
with you and the type of folks that you represent around this 
country ladies and gentlemen the growth hope and opportunity 
wing of the republican party is going to prevail over the orthodox 
statusquo wing of our party kemp said 
kemp campaign adviser roger stone said the thirdplace finish 
would help kemp substantially in the south 
as the agenda moves south its the most conservative part of 
the country and we think his message will be well accepted 
there stone said 
a former pro football player whos a strong anticommunist and 
is strong on defense issues is better for the south than a 
connecticut yankee son of a wall street banker he said 
referring to bush 
stone said the campaign has about 100000 on hand and a list of 
100000 donors nationwide he predicted that tuesdays results will 
increase kemps ability to raise funds

alleys and bangs and crackles filled the air as china today 
welcomed the year of the dragon with the traditional fireworks 
greeting 
the government decreed a cutback this year in firecracker sales 
in beijing due to the high toll in injuries and property damage 
but when midnight struck residents brought out their firepower in 
force 
the lunar new year renamed spring festival after the 1949 
communist takeover traditionally is chinas most important 
holiday it has been welcomed with more than usual fanfare because 
this is the year of the dragon the most auspicious of the 12 
animals in chinese astrology 
the symbol of china is considered lucky for business marriage 
and the dragon babies born before it ends 
vietnam ushered in the lunar new year with an official 
remembrance of its historic tet offensive 20 years ago 
the official voice of vietnam radio recounted myths of the 
dragon but much of the broadcast punctuated by the sounds of 
battle was devoted to recalling the offensive that began jan 30 
1968 
communist forces then attacked more than 100 cities and towns 
throughout south vietnam suffering enormous casualties as us and 
south vietnamese forces drove them back 
the offensive convinced some americans the war was unwinnable 
and fueled the us antiwar movement instrumental in achieving an 
american withdrawal in late 1973 the communists went on to win in 
1975 
the attacks sent shock waves across the world and shook the 
white house said the broadcast monitored in bangkok the us 
ruling circles were forced to think of a withdrawal and to sit down 
at the negotiating table in paris 
in south korea millions of people crowded trains and buses to 
join their families for the new years celebration which begins on 
thursday in korea as many as 7 million people were expected to 
travel crosscountry to spend the holiday feasting playing 
traditional games and enjoying other festivities

workers maids restaurant waiters left their jobs to welcome the 
lunar new year with feasts gambling and visits to relatives with 
gifts of candy and lai see lucky money for children 
top chinese leader deng xiaoping welcomed the new year at a 
party in shanghai the official xinhua news agency reported it was 
the 83yearold dengs first reported public appearance since jan 
20 
xinhua said deng received an ovation from the more than 700 
people attending the party at the shanghai exhibition center and 
that he waved back all smiles 
markets in china were crammed with festival foods railroad 
stations were full of holiday travelers and signs emblazoned with 
dragons heralded the start of the year 4686 
thousands of people from taiwan where chiang kaisheks 
nationalists fled after the communist victory of 1949 were 
expected to visit the mainland last year taiwans government 
lifted a ban on visits to allow family reunions 
government statistics indicate about 400000 of hong kongs 57 
million people had left by tuesday for holidays abroad and many 
more were expected to go 
the probeijing china travel service estimated 18 million 
people from hong kong would spend the holiday in china primarily 
in the neighboring province of guangdong where many have their 
ancestral roots 
a company official said about 6000 people from taiwan were 
expected to visit the mainland 
during the new year festivities normally thrifty chinese throw 
financial caution to the winds and blow several months pay on good 
cheer gifts and games of chance 
about 27 million worth of fireworks were sold in beijing last 
year and some families spent as much as 54 the equivalent of two

key defense issues such as shortrange 
nuclear missiles and chemical weapons are likely to be on the 
agenda when chancellor helmut kohl meets with president reagan in 
washington this week 
kohl left for washington today for the threeday visit that will 
include talks with president reagan secretary of state george p 
shultz and leading members of congress 
the opposition social democratic party called on the chancellor 
to press for a reduction in shortrange nuclear missiles in central 
europe during the washington talks 
the chancellor should work toward a concept for the withdrawal 
of shortrange missiles the partys arms control expert karsten 
voigt was quoted by the neuen osnabruecker newspaper as saying 
in recent days west german government officials have pointed 
out differences of opinion on these topics and urged the nato 
alliance to develop an overall arms control strategy before 
pursuing new talks with the soviet union 
before we sit at the table with the soviets on new 
disarmament proposals we need to have agreement within the 
nato alliance on overall strategy a topranking west german 
official told reporters tuesday 
officials said kohl is likely to press for a worldwide ban on 
chemical weapons 
us officials have said it would be difficult to verify such a 
ban but west german experts contend that verification problems can 
be worked out 
we think the eastwest chemical weapons talks have reached a 
point where it is possible to reach an agreement this year said 
the west german official who spoke on condition that he not be 
further identified 
the official said west germans are aware that us arms control 
negotiators are emphasizing working out reductions in strategic 
nuclear weapons and dont feel that the genevabased chemical 
weapons talks are on the brink of agreement 
but it is important for us to represent our european interests 
within the nato alliance he added 
shortrange nuclear missiles or those with a range of less than 
300 miles are expected to be a main point of kohls talks in 
washington us officials in recent weeks have emphasized the 
importance of implementing a 1983 nato decision to upgrade the 
shortrange nuclear weapons in central europe 
us and other nato officials have said the shortrange missiles 
are now more important to the alliance because of last decembers 
superpower arms treaty which if ratified will scrap all 
landbased mediumrange missiles 
but the west german government says nato must first develop 
overall arms control strategies and insists on reductions in soviet 
superiority in conventional arms before upgrading the alliances 
shortrange missiles 
the federal republic of germany sees no need for an isolated 
decision on modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear 
weapon systems at this point friedhelm ost chief government 
spokesman said monday 
such decisions should be taken only after new overall 
disarmament concepts are worked out he added

a woman who police say gave birth to 
premature twin boys in her apartment and then smoked cocaine while 
they died in her bathroom has been charged with two counts of

nasa says it will choose in april between two 
crew escape systems for the space shuttle in time to install the 
system in the shuttle discovery for the restart of the manned 
flight program 
discovery now is scheduled to lift off from the kennedy space 
center on aug 4 it already is outfitted with an escape hatch that 
can be jettisoned with explosives a change from previous flights 
in which opening the hatch was a laborious timeconsuming effort 
one of the emergency systems would have crew members one at a 
time hook on to small tractor rockets stored in the cabin the 
astronauts would be pulled clear of the spacecraft and would 
parachute to the ocean 
the second system first tested in wind tunnels and now by 
military volunteers in c141 aircraft at edwards air force base in 
california involves a telescoping pole that would extend down and 
to the rear of the shuttle astronauts would attach themselves to 
rings on the pole slide clear of the shuttle and then parachute 
the two systems the pole and the rocket both provide the 
capability for us to get away from the wing should we have to jump 
out the side rick hauck commander of the fiveman crew on the 
first mission told a senate hearing tuesday 
if both those tests turn out to be adequate to do the job i 
think it would be common sense that we would prefer to have the 
system that is the simplest that involves the least amount of 
potential hazard 
the escape system would be useful only on a controlled level 
flight not while the shuttles booster rockets are firing as was 
the case in the challenger accident in 1986

an afghan guerrilla leader today 
urged pakistan not to sign an agreement to end the civil war in 
afghanistan unless an opposition government is established there 
first 
it will be a historic blunder if pakistan signs the geneva 
peace agreements in their present forms gulbaddin hekmatyar 
chief of the islamic party guerrillas told a news conference 
meanwhile a soviet foreign ministry official accused pakistan 
of trying to delay the pullout by demanding an agreement on the 
makeup of a new interim afghan government 
a final round of the unsponsored talks between islamabad and 
kabul is to open in geneva on march 2 negotiators are expected to 
try to reach peace agreements to end the eightyear war which has 
pitted the moslem guerrillas against an estimated 115000 soviet 
troops and a small afghan army 
pakistan the united states china and other countries support 
the guerrillas and are represented by islamabad at the geneva 
talks soviet views are represented by officials from kabul 
hekmatyar who heads the largest group in the sevenparty 
guerrilla alliance headquartered in pakistan said islamabad should 
retain its present demand for a government dominated by the 
guerrillas and shared by other afghans to be installed in kabul 
before a peace accord is signed 
in a statement feb 8 soviet leader mikhail gorbachev offered 
to start withdrawing his troops on may 15 provided the peace 
agreements are signed by march 15 
he said that a pullout would not be contingent on a separate 
agreement on the makeup of a transitional afghan government 
hekmatyar said the proposal implied that the moscowbacked 
government of president najib would remain in power and the 
insurgents would play no role 
gorbachevs proposal will cunningly leave the najib government 
in power when the soviets withdraw and afghan refugees will be 
allowed to return home but it will not lead to peace said 
hekmatyar considered among the most hardline of the guerrilla 
leaders 
hekmatyar renewed the guerrillas call for moscow to begin 
direct talks with the guerillas the soviets and the insurgents he 
said are the only parties involved in the afghan fighting 
such negotiations could lead to the formation of an interim 
government which will organize elections to establish a permanent 
elected government and a parliament he said 
hekmatyar said the seven guerrilla parties would draw up a list 
of people acceptable for the proposed government the names would 
include guerrillas afghan refugees and afghan moslems and exclude 
communists he said 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
that pakistan has been trying to delay the pullout by urging the 
soviet union to find a formula for a future afghan government 
a domestic afghan settlement is a cause for the afghans 
themselves and it depends only on them which ways to choose for 
the purpose gerasimov said 
outside parties can assist the process but not at the expense 
of the withdrawal talks gerasimov said in remarks reported by the 
tass news agency 
he said the pakistani sides attempts to keep away from 
concluding the geneva process are tantamount to an intention to 
frustrate the entire afghan settlement 
the pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement feb 16 that 
only by linking its withdrawal to an agreement on an interim 
government could the soviet union assure an end to the fighting 
iranian president ali khamenei told the soviet deputy foreign 
minister vladimir petrovsky that any pullout accord must prevent 
the united states and its allies from wielding influence in 
afghanistan according to a report broadcast tuesday by tehrans 
islamic republic news agency 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 replaced 
one prosoviet government with another and remained to fight the 
insurgents many of the guerrilla groups fight from bases across 
the border in neighboring pakistan

jesse jackson said today he hopes to get 
support from bruce babbitt if babbitt drops out of the democratic 
presidential race as expected while paul simon set the stage for 
his withdrawal if he doesnt win somewhere next week 
jackson who finished fourth said he and babbitt discussed the 
former arizona governors political future as voters were casting 
the ballots that left babbitt in sixth place tuesday night 
he wanted to discuss what his options were which he is still 
wrestling with with his wife hattie jackson said on cbs this 
morning hes not made a final judgment 
jackson quickly added i hope i get his support 
simon who finished third in the democratic race behind michael 
dukakis and richard gephardt said the balloting next week would 
determine his political future 
i have to win either in south dakota or minnesota and we have 
to get additional campaign contributions he said on nbc those 
two things have to be there otherwise im going to have to 
withdraw you have to win somewhere 
after iowas caucuses last week alexander m haig jr withdrew 
from the republican presidential race 
babbitt who also appeared on the cbs program indicated today 
that he would like to continue his campaign saying ive devoted 
a year to talking to the american people 
his wife who joined him in the interview added i think 
well keep going with the message of this campaign 
babbitt said tuesday it was premature for jackson and former 
colorado sen gary hart to be wooing his backers saying he would 
spend a few days in washington and call and talk to my supporters 
all over the country and ask them this question how can we 
keep this reform movement alive 
he had said prior to the new hampshire primary that the states 
voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy 
republican rep jack kemp of new york got 13 percent of the gop 
vote and voiced optimism today over his thirdplace showing behind 
vice president george bush and dole 
were going to do well in minnesota kemp said on the abc 
program 
the new york congressman added that people recognize we are 
viable we are confident that we will be able to raise money 
pete du pont who got 10 percent of the gop vote found cause to 
cheer in that fourthplace showing just ahead of pat robertson in 
the fiveman republican race 
point is weve all finished together du pont said of the 
trio on the gops bottom rung and on his prospects in the days 
ahead we did much better in new hampshire than we did in iowa 
well do much better in the south than we did in new hampshire 
robertson who finished with 9 percent said the south would be 
a welcome change after iowa which was doles neighborhood and new 
hampshire which was claimed by bush tomorrow morning i go into 
the south and theyre going to be playing in my backyard 
for the democrats though neither jackson nor gore got a new 
england boost to take south both were sure to find friendlier 
territory in dixie 
weve already been saving our resources for super tuesday 
said gore in an interview from houston on cbs ive spent more 
time here than other candidates 
both hart and jackson who happened upon babbitt at cable news 
networks studio in manchester as the votes rolled in tuesday 
night huddled with the former arizona governor to ask his support 
should he withdraw 
our message has tremendous overlap i hope that in time we 
will work out some common ground in terms of our politics said 
jackson who finished with 8 percent ahead of gores 7 percent 
babbitts 5 percent and harts 4 percent 
hart said he expects to be a candidate as far ahead in the 
future as i can see but he added i understand that there are 
standards that have to be met in terms of delegates and votes he 
said it will take at least 30 to 60 days to determine if i can 
put together a viable candidacy

this is a cause 
gephardt continued his campaign theme of change as he left new 
hampshire for south dakota which holds a primary next tuesday 
this is not a candidacy this is a cause and the cause is

policy inspiring and motivating our corporate leaders to stop the 
paper profits and to start looking at how we do the business of 
america again to make good products he told cbs this 
morning 
gephardt said his showing in the new hampshire democratic 
presidential primary leaves him positioned to do great in the 
south 
it appears to me that weve got a dukakisgephardt race 
through the rest of the country gephardt said tuesday night 
final but unofficial results gave massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis 37 percent gephardt the congressman from missouri 20 
percent and sen paul simon of illinois 18 percent 
at his campaign headquarters in manchester gephardt began a 
jubilant victory statement by saying i love new hampshire 
everybody said the gephardt campaign couldnt do it in new 
hampshire he told cheering supporters 
well we said that this is one nation one people and we 
proved that the people of new hampshire are a part of this country 
and care about this country and about this cause 
gephardt insisted that his campaigns finances were in good 
shape for the move south he said loans to the campaign were made 
against federal matching funds which he will receive later 
its a cashflow situation he said we didnt borrow 
money that we didnt have coming so were in good shape were 
going to do fine for super tuesday 
gephardt pointed to a recent usa today poll that put him first 
in the south in front of dukakis simon al gore and jesse jackson 
asked whether simons thirdplace showing would put him out of 
the race gephardt said he didnt know 
paul has run a good campaign hes a fine man and thats his 
decision he said 
simon and gephardt had been concentrating their fire on each 
other until the weekend when both switched to advertisements 
attacking dukakis 
jim demers cochairman of gephardts new hampshire campaign 
noted that dukakis now has a gold medal and a bronze after 
his thirdplace iowa showing and tuesdays victory gephardt picked 
up the metaphor later saying ive got a gold and a silver 
gephardt said he was especially happy to have won in manchester 
which is the states largest city there he beat dukakis 29 percent 
to 27 percent 
gephardt planned to leave the state early this morning for south 
dakota where he will spend six of the seven days before the 
states primary feb 23

mayor dick crawford easily defeated his 
challenger in the republican primary for city hall and will face a 
state senator in the april general election 
weve been looking to get this out of the way so we can get to 
the main event crawford said after his victory tuesday night 
over businessman tom quinn 
crawford 54 who waged a minimal primary campaign won the 
republican nomination with 14952 votes or 61 percent according 
to unofficial results from all 188 precincts quinn received 38 
percent of the vote or 9327 votes 
crawfords opponent in the april 5 race is democratic state sen 
rodger randle who contended quinns relatively strong showing 
against an incumbent indicates voters are not pleased with crawford 
quinn only recently joined the gop to stop crawford from running 
unopposed randle also noted quinn a sign company president had 
defeated democratic mayor terry young in the 1986 primary 
it certainly would have to be a disappointment to mr crawford 
to have mr quinn run so well against him randle said 
randle won the democratic nomination with 57 percent of the 
ballots cast or 20507 votes former tulsa water and sewer 
commissioner patty eaton came in second with 13361 votes or 37 
percent 
the other four candidates in the democratic primary received a 
little more than 5 percent of the votes cast 
tuesdays election had a record turnout with more than 70000 
of the 250000 registered voters casting ballots tulsa county 
election board secretary scott orbison said 
randle 44 has been a member of the oklahoma legislature for 17 
years and served as senate president pro tempore he lost his first 
race for mayor in 1978 to republican jim inhofe now a congressman 
from oklahomas 1st district

a fire broke out today in an unoccupied 
fifthfloor room of the us embassy in moscow forcing about 150 
people to flee the building to a snowstorm outside 
flames leaped from windows on the fifth floor of the aging 
10story building and smoke continued to pour out for an hour 
after it was evacuated 
soviet firefighters were summoned to the scene in midafternoon 
and were escorted by us marine guards into the embassy compound 
the blaze apparently began in an unoccupied room in an area 
undergoing renovation 
philip brown a senior embassy spokesman said the cause of the 
fire had not been determined no injuries were reported 
the building leased to the united states by the soviet 
government since the 1950s was to have been replaced by a new 
diplomatic complex but the embassy building at the center of that 
complex remains vacant and unfinished following discovery that it 
was riddled with soviet eavesdropping devices 
about 150 embassy employees were in the building when the fire 
broke out ambassador jack matlock was not at the embassy at the 
time but returned after the evacuation press attache richard 
gilbert said 
gilbert said the fire might be construction related but it 
has not been determined the spokesman said there was no serious 
damage to the main working areas of the embassy which are located 
on the sixth floor and above 
most of the 40 apartments once used by guards and diplomats have 
been vacated in recent months as officials have moved into the 
modern brick townhouses that surround the new embassy building 
the diplomats and embassy workers were ordered out of their 
offices and stood on the sidewalk in a snowstorm to watch firemen 
combat the fire 
the blaze occurred in a section of the building that had been 
used to house navy seabees members of construction battalions 
and workers brought to moscow on temporary assignment but a 
spokesman said the corner room where the fire broke out was not 
being occupied at the time 
much of the building which is in poor repair is under 
renovation while officials in washington ponder what to do with 
their new embassy building less than a block away 
a soviet fire official said the blaze was confined to one room 
and that no injuries were reported embassy employees were told to 
take the rest of the day off because the building could not be 
occupied for at least several hours 
brown said embassy officials decided about 30 minutes after the 
blaze was discovered that they couldnt contain it without 
assistance and moscow fire trucks were called to the scene 
marine guards who are responsible for security inside the 
compound escorted the firemen and their vehicles into the 
courtyard of the prerevolutionary mansion and accompanied the 
firefighters as they trained hoses on the blaze and entered the 
main embassy building with gas masks and extinguishers 
us reps dan mica dfla and olympia snowe rmaine during 
an inspection of the embassy last april pronounced it a firetrap 
and unsafe by accepted standards for general working conditions 
a more serious fire ravaged the top floors of the embassy 
building in august 1977 officials said afterward the damage was 
particularly severe because ambassador malcolm toon refused to 
permit soviet firefighters to enter the topsecurity embassy 
communications center and some of its most sensitive work areas to 
combat the blaze 
in washington a senior official said the fire was contained to 
an unclassified area and was unrelated to talks that secretary of 
state george p shultz will open sunday with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the fire was a fire said assistant secretary of state 
rozanne l ridgway it would be totally wrong it would be 
fiction to try to have it have anything to do with the upcoming 
visit 
shultz will hold talks with shevardnadze on arms control 
negotiations human rights and a prospective withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan they also will make preparations for a 
summit meeting in moscow next spring between president reagan and 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
ms ridgway who is in charge of the european bureau at the 
state department and will accompany shultz said the fire 
affected our communications somewhat with the embassy and that 
she did not have all the details 
the embassy and its operations in moscow have been the center of 
controversy for more than a year 
a scandal exploded around accusations that marine guards 
influenced by soviet women with whom they were illicitly 
associating had permitted soviet agents inside secret areas of the 
embassy when no diplomats were present those charges were never 
proved but a marine was convicted in august of espionage 
officials disclosed in 1986 that the new 191 million embassy 
already five years behind schedule would not be finished or 
occupied until they decided whether it could be made secure from 
electronic bugs 
proposals include razing part or all of the new building or 
building a new structure in the complex to house communications 
facilities and secret operations

narcotics agents mistakenly raided a 
ministers house after counting from the wrong end of the block 
officials said 
i thought they were robbers said hector sanchez whose 
daughter noemi woke him up early sunday to say three men were in 
the backyard with crowbars and guns 
sanchez a minister at the spanish assembly of god church says 
he asked the men what they wanted and they told him to stop or be 
shot they then followed him into the house sanchez said 
when he one of the officers told me he was from the state 
police i was relieved sanchez said but i was still 
frightened 
his wife and two daughters sat in the living room while the men 
went through the house and out front where they ran into the rest 
of the raiding party and learned of their mistake 
sgt don bush blames of the department of public safety 
narcotics division blames human error 
the department had assigned men to two groups bush said one 
group was supposed to enter the targeted home from the front and 
the other the group that raided the sanchez home was supposed 
to guard the rear 
because the houses dont have numbers on the back the group in 
the rear was instructed to count houses from the corner bush said 
the problem he said was that they started counting at the wrong 
end of the block 
later sunday public safety officers and the abilene police 
departments special services bureau arrested seven people down the 
block

the journal of the american medical association 
says it will not comply with an order to name an essayist who 
claimed in a recent issue to have committed a mercy killing 
a subpoena was served tuesday by the cook county states 
attorneys office regarding a jan 8 essay titled its over 
debbie said kirk johnson general counsel for the nations 
largest organization of doctors 
although the ama strongly condemns mercy killing its 
journal will not comply with the subpoena he said in a statement 
dr george lundberg the editor in chief of jama has invoked 
the privilege protecting information obtained by reporters in the 
course of their work as provided in the illinois reporters 
privilege act johnson said 
the act says a person seeking privileged or protected 
information must apply in writing to the circuit court to set aside 
the protection he said 
the act also says the court may overrule the privilege only 
when after a hearing it finds all other sources have been 
exhausted and disclosure of the information is essential to 
protection of the public interest said johnson 
because the states attorneys office has not complied with 
these requirements of the act jama will not comply with the 
subpoena the attorney said 
terry levin a spokesman for the prosecutors office said 
tuesday we have no comment and in fact are not confirming we 
are even looking into this 
in the article a doctor described injecting a fatal dose of 
morphine into a terminally ill young woman he had never seen before 
who suffered from ovarian cancer 
ama officials have said they did not verify the purported mercy 
killing but believe it was based on fact they said the author 
requested anonymity 
handing over information would inhibit jama and other media 
from publishing information from sources who wish to remain 
anonymous johnsons statement said thus disclosure would 
strike at the heart of the reporters privilege act and the first 
amendment interests which it seeks to protect 
the ama and its journal are based in chicago the essay did not 
indicate where the author lived or where the purported incident 
took place

the late roy cohn says in his autobiography that 
the judge in the famous rosenberg spy case decided before the trial 
that he would put julius rosenberg to death 
cohn was a member of the prosecution team excerpts from his 
yettobe published autobiography written with journalist sidney 
zion were published tuesday in new york magazine 
cohn who was 24 at the time of the 1951 spy trial also 
asserted that us district judge irving r kaufman telephoned him 
during the trial to seek his advice on a penalty for ethel 
rosenberg 
cohn said he recommended the death penalty 
the rosenbergs were convicted of selling atomic secrets to the 
soviet union and were executed in 1953 
a law clerk for kaufman who is still on the bench said the 
judge is not available and its the policy of the chambers not to 
comment on press reports 
cohn who became chief counsel to sen joseph mccarthy during 
the red scare hearings of the 1950s died of heart failure and 
aidsrelated illnesses in august 1986 
during a stormy career that included bitter runins with the 
internal revenue service and many public figures cohns veracity 
was frequently challenged 
in the book cohn recalled that kaufman said he sought divine 
guidance before deciding on the rosenbergs sentences 
i cant confirm or deny this so far as i know the closest he 
got to prayer was the phone booth next to the park avenue 
synagogue he called from that booth to a phone behind the bench in 
the courtroom to ask my advice on whether he ought to give the 
death penalty to ethel rosenberg there was never any question 
about julius kaufman had told me before the trial started that he 
was going to sentence julius rosenberg to death 
cohn said kaufman was concerned about public reaction to a woman 
being executed 
cohn said he told kaufman that shes worse than julius so 
unless youre willing to say that a woman is immune from the death 
penalty i dont see how you can justify sparing her

bob dole said today that he made a mistake in 
not responding to charges from george bush in the closing hours of 
the new hampshire primary campaign but aides promised dole would 
react very very forcefully to future attacks 
the senate republican leader looking to recover from a big loss 
in the granite state tuesday vowed to correct what he said are the 
lies in bushs campaign ads 
im going to try to go out and straighten it out im not 
going to run from it im not known for running from a fight 
dole said at the manchester airport before flying to washington 
i never said i was going to raise your taxes i didnt say i was 
advocating a 10abarrel import fee but thats what bushs ads 
say and they are not true 
flying back to take part in the senate debate on campaign 
financing dole was asked if he had been too soft on bush 
probably dole told reporters on the plane 
and queried on whether he should have not let bushs charges go 
unanswered dole said yes thats my guess 
dole said in manchester that he thought he had done well to 
finish second against bush in a state the vice president says is 
his neighbor but he said the boost he got out of his iowa victory 
on feb 8 was overrated 
i think our expectations got out of hand dole said i 
think we sat on our hands for three days 
dole brushed aside suggestions that he would now return to the 
style of the mean old bob dole saying the nation is seeing a 
mean george bush 
theyve got the axes and they seem to be swinging them in 
every state dole said 
william brock doles campaign manager underscored the new 
forcefulness the campaign plans against bush attacks 
when he does it from now on were going to respond very very 
forcefully brock said on the plane were tired of it were 
sick to the gills of this type of tactic 
but brock said the campaign would not respond in kind 
negative against negative 
were not going to play their game were not going to put up 
with the effort to distort the record brock told reporters we 
dont have to wallow in the mud with them to answer their charges 
when they are wrong we are going to point it out 
although bushs convincing victory tuesday night blunted doles 
postiowa momentum dole and his aides forced a positive face on 
the new hampshire results 
but the frustration was apparent when dole and bush were 
interviewed from different locations by tom brokaw of nbc 
after bush wished dole well as the campaigns moved south dole 
made his sharp comment referring to lastday television ads by the 
bush campaign that claimed dole supports tax increases and social 
security cuts 
you shouldnt distort someones record dole said i could 
do that to him but i wont 
he vowed to straighten out my record it wont take long 
for the campaign of a sitting republican vice president to 
engage in the kind of base distortions of this weekend is demeaning 
to that office and demeaning to our party said sen warren 
rudman of new hampshire a key dole backer 
doles own big win in iowa last week had helped boost his 
standing in new hampshire polls once 20 points behind he pulled 
even a few days before the voting 
but the drive faltered and tuesday nights results left the 
senate minority leader at 29 percent nine points behind bush 
dole was still 16 points ahead of the next gop contender rep 
jack kemp and dole and his aides insisted tuesday night that 
bushs victory was nothing to crow about 
obviously we would have liked to have won here dole said 
we didnt quite do that but we did a lot 
brock said we were down more than 20 points eight days ago 
and to have come this close that is a tremendous commentary on 
bob dole its also a commentary on the softness of the vice 
presidents supporters 
but he also indicated that the tone of the campaign is likely to 
change saying bush has 21 days to start telling the truth and 
dealing with issues and were going to give him a countdown day 
by day

a new york state law forbidding loitering in 
subway train or bus stations is unconstitutional because it puts 
people too much at the mercy of police the states top court ruled 
today 
the law forbids people from sleeping in transportation 
facilities or staying there without giving authorities a 
satisfactory explanation of what theyre doing 
in a decision written by judge vito titone the court of appeals 
said the statute failed to give a person of ordinary 
intelligence notice that his conduct is against the law 
such a generalized law fails to distinguish between conduct 
calculated to cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent 
thereby failing to give adequate notice of what conduct is 
prohibited titone wrote in the 70 ruling 
the court ruled unanimously in favor of two new york city men 
who were arrested in 1985 for loitering in incidents at penn 
station and the port authority bus terminal 
paul bright was arrested after showing an open satchel to 
passersby at penn station when bright failed to produce 
identification to a policeman he was told he was being arrested 
for loitering he was also charged with possessing stolen credit 
cards according to court records 
alfred clark was arrested at the port authority after he failed 
to give police an explanation of what he was doing there an 
officer searching clark had found cocaine and a pipe in his jacket 
the manhattan district attorneys office argued that the 
requirement that police give a satisfactory explanation why the 
conduct is illegal was enough to make the law stand 
but the court said the law leaves it up to the police officer to 
decide whether an explanation is satisfactory that vitone wrote 
makes the law unconstitutional 
requiring a person to explain his actions also violates a 
persons right to remain silent when questioned by police the 
court said 
he is faced with the choice of either foregoing his 
constitutional right to remain silent in the hope that his 
explanation will satisfy that particular law enforcement official 
or invoking his constitutional right to remain silent and being 
arrested vitone wrote 
barbara sheehan who argued the case for the district attorneys 
office said she would withhold comment until she has a chance to 
read the ruling 
an antiloitering law was first enacted by the legislature in 
1939 the law then noted that subways and railroad stations had 
become attractive for fakers perverts pickpockets loiterers 
sleepers flimflam men etc who infested these properties night 
and day 
after being amended in 1953 the law was passed in its current 
form in 1965

east german newspapers today printed pictures of 
dismantled missiles and hailed soviet preparations for removing 
ss12 nuclear missiles before a superpower treaty scrapping 
intermediaterange weapons is ratified 
in the name of reason a historic moment awaits said a

partys youth newspaper 
soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the ddr east 
germany troops in waren dismantle mediumrange rockets earlier 
than expected neues deutschland new germany said in a headline

north of berlin 
removal of missile troops starts earlier than expected 
transfer to the soviet union and destruction of their type ss12 
armaments in the ussr the east berlin daily berliner zeitung 
said 
west germanys main opposition party the social democrats 
called on the west german government to follow east germanys lead 
in getting rid of nuclear weapons early 
the partys disarmament expert in parliament hermann scheer 
told reporters in bonn today that chancellor helmut kohls 
government should respond with early scrapping west germanys 72 
pershing 1a missiles 
east germanys staterun news agency adn said tuesday night that 
missiles in waren had been taken apart put in crates and were 
ready for transport back to the soviet union 
with this step we can make an important contribution toward 
disarmament even before the treaty between the united states and 
the soviet union is ratified adn said 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed 
the treaty in washington last december agreeing to eliminate all 
landbased medium and shorterrange missiles 
the agreement stipulates that the soviets shorterrange 
missiles in east germany and in czechoslovakia are to be removed 
within 18 months and mediumrange us and soviet missiles within 
three years 
the senate has not ratified the treaty the supreme soviet the 
soviet unions parliament is expected to approve the accord 
in washington the state department had no immediate reaction to 
the report 
a us official however said the soviets were free to take 
down their missiles before the treaty takes effect the official 
who demanded anonymity said us inspectors will go to east 
germany and all other soviet missile sites to verify the soviets 
were complying with the treaty if it is ratified 
although there was no comment in moscow on the reported 
dismantling gorbachev on tuesday criticized western european 
countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the 
superpower treaty 
the official tass news agency quoted gorbachev as criticizing 
western european governments for the latest wave of praise for 
the nuclear deterrence strategy all manner of projects for 
the joint manufacture of newest weapons the francowest german 
military rapprochement and so forth 
west german government officials declined comment on the report 
tuesday night it is too early for us to comment at this time 
a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
the associated press 
adn did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when 
they would be returned to the soviet union only that soviet 
soldiers are making the last preparations to return their ss12 
rockets 
the rockets are shorterrange weapons included in the 
intermediaterange missile treaty which bans weapons with a range 
of 300 miles to 3000 miles 
east german television late tuesday showed soldiers loading 
missile crates onto transport vehicles 
adn quoted a soviet military officer as saying the troops are 
very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit the 
rockets are to be sent back to the soviet union by train adn said 
it said east german journalists who toured the missile base were 
allowed to interview soviet soldiers 
erich honecker the east german leader indicated in january 
that soviet intermediaterange rockets stationed in east germany 
could be removed ahead of schedule but he gave no specific 
timetable 
according to figures released after the treaty was signed 22 
rockets 12 launchers nine transport vehicles and seven practice 
missiles were stationed at the neubrandenburg site which holds the 
largest numbers of ss12s in east germany there are three other 
ss12 rocket sites in east germany 
in all there are 54 ss12s in east germany according to those 
figures 
the soviet union also has 53 ss23 shorterrange nuclear rockets

alain savary the education minister whose policies 
sent millions protesting in the streets and threatened to bring 
down the government has died the socialist party announced today 
he was 69 
according to the statement savary had been hospitalized for 
several weeks with a serious infection it did not say when he died 
or state the cause of death 
a member of the french resistance during world war ii savary 
had a reputation for being softspoken but stubborn 
he was one of the leaders of the postliberation french 
government a member of the national assembly and first held 
ministerial positions under president charles de gaulle 
as education minister savary proposed a bill in 1984 that 
attempted to institute president francois mitterrands campaign 
promise to revamp the nations private education system 
among other things the reform bill gave local authorities more 
control over management and financing of private schools where 
nearly 16 percent of frances 12 million children are educated 
the savary law inflamed passions for months opponents felt it 
threatened the basic right to choose how to educate their children 
supporters wished to hold mitterrand to his election promise of 
creating a unified secular public education service 
a daylong demonstration against the bill drew at least 15 
million people to the capital on june 24 1984 
organizers compared the crowds to those that thronged the champs 
elysee in 1968 after student riots and in 1944 after the liberation 
of paris 
pierre mauroy the premier at the time of the savary law 
controversy said the reforms had been totally misunderstood 
but the socialists who long opposed private schools withdrew the 
bill 
the controversy caused a government reshuffle in which savary 
resigned he was replaced by jean pierre chevenment and mauroy was 
replaced by laurent fabius 
lionel jospin secretary of the socialist party expressed his 
very sincere condolences to the family and friends of savary 
who served as education minister from 1981 until 1984 
courageous lucid discrete alain savary put loyalty and 
honor behind his convictions he will remain one of the great names 
of socialism said jospin 
savary was party secretary from 1969 to 1971 and was one of 
the moving forces behind the partys renaissance jospin said 
he represented socialism with his strong sense of morality 
his sense of justice and his commitment to the decolonization of 
africa jospin said 
born april 25 1918 in the french colony of algiers algeria 
savary was a strong advocate of decolonization he served as 
secretary of state for moroccan and tunisian affairs in 1956 but 
quit to protest french actions during the frenchalgerian war

the iowa supreme court today said lower 
courts may authorize sterilization of mentally retarded people but 
refused to spell out guidelines under which the procedure is 
appropriate 
in a narrowly drawn opinion the justices agreed that courts can 
act on a request that mentally retarded people be sterilized even 
though a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977 
we conclude that our district courts possess subject matter 
jurisdiction over and accordingly may hear and determine 
applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentally 
incapacitated ward the high court said 
a stinging dissent said the court was wandering into a subject 
shot through with searching social and ethical questions 
in taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself to 
the eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendant 
social and ethical issues said justice k david harris future 
litigants faced with unanswered questions of great social and 
ethical dimensions or with missing ingredients of a vague 
application process will continue to press us for determinations 
we are singularly unfit to reach 
but the majority rejected that reasoning 
stated another way we do not believe our courts lack 
jurisdiction over a case merely because the case is important or 
unavoidably includes a constitutional dimension the court said 
the 71 decision came in a polk county case in which jan and 
tekla matejski are the legal guardians of their 33yearold 
mentally retarded daughter court records said 
the couple filed an application with a lower court seeking 
authorization to have their daughter sterilized but a lawyer 
appointed by the court to guard the womans rights objected 
claiming theres no provision in iowa law allowing sterilization 
polk county judge glenn e pille agreed and dismissed the 
application 
both sides appealed arguing over whether courts have the power 
to order sterilization but going one step further and asking the 
high court to set groundrules 
lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the legislature 
repealed a law providing for sterilization of people who are 
mentally ill or retarded syphilitic habitual criminals moral 
degenerates or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society 
but while agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests 
the high court refused to spell out guidelines 
we are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given the 
posture of the present case the court said the excursion 
suggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisory 
opinion 
harris said the decision would haunt the justices 
at what level of mental retardation can sterilization be 
compelled harris asked what board or body if any will 
suggest statewide standards

nineyearold kendall smith smiling and 
carrying a new musical keyboard under his arm walked out of the 
hospital today more than a month after he fell into a pond and was 
trapped 40 minutes under the ice 
hes a normal kid and hes going to go back to doing the 
normal things dr karen powers told reporters at a news 
conference 
were all humbled as caretakers to see what many of us would 
consider if not miraculous a nearmiraculous recovery added 
fred tecklenburg another of kendalls attending physicians at the 
medical university of south carolina hospital 
he said kendall who lives in dillon is one of about five 
children in the medical literature to have recovered after having 
been under water for more than 30 minutes 
kendall wearing black jeans with suspenders a blue striped 
shirt and a white hat was asked how he felt good he said and 
smiled shyly he said he knew he would have to go back to school 
but said he wasnt quite ready for that 
in addition to the keyboard donated by a electronics store 
kendall also received a bicycle from a store 
ms powers said kendall might need more therapy to build his 
strength and endurance and might start back at school on a halfday 
schedule tecklenburg added kendall tested at his age level on 
standardized tests administered about 10 days ago 
kendall and two other children were playing on the frozen 
surface of a pond jan 12 when the ice gave way his companions 
were rescued quickly but it was almost 40 minutes before rescuers 
pulled kendall out with grappling hooks 
doctors have said the time he spent under the water is as long 
as has been recored for anyone who has survived a neardrowning in 
icy water the bodys metabolism slows and the brain doesnt need 
as much oxygen 
the reflex is particularly powerful in children doctors say 
kendall was in a coma for two weeks but when he regained 
consciousness made dramatic improvement

discussed poisoning the water of new york and washington to 
undermine the government a prosecutor said today in his opening 
statement at the trial of 14 supremacists 
authorities contend the defendants sought to establish an aryan

other crimes from july 1983 to april 1985 to reach their goal

ellison had about 200 pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession at 
that time snyder said 
miles 63 of cohoctah mich and butler 69 of hayden lake 
idaho are considered two of the top three supremacist leaders the 
third louis ray beam jr 41 of houston also is on trial

the use of peremptory challenges in which lawyers can strike a 
limited number of people from the panel without showing cause

black prospective jurors whether they would be fair to defendants 
who believe in separation of the races and in white supremacy

in texas texas authorities said beam led a campaign of violent 
intimidation of vietnamese fishermen in the galveston area in a 
letter obtained by government agents beam said the united states

government say government investigators

the israeli national tourist 
bureau has canceled an advertisement it was running in dutch 
newspapers that said tel aviv and jerusalem were only a stones 
throw apart a bureau spokesman said wednesday 
the bureau withdrew the ad because of the ongoing unrest in the 
israelioccupied territories where palestinian youths frequently 
hurl rocks and other objects at troops said spokesman albert 
kooistra 
the ad which ran last week in two newspapers and in three tv 
program guides was meant to emphasize the short distances between 
israels cities and other tourist sites kooistra said 
the distance between tel aviv and jerusalem about a stones 
throw kooistra quoted the ad as saying 
speaking figuratively thats true only i think the text must 
have caused something of a shock in the current context he said 
jerusalem another frequent venue for recent protests and tel 
aviv are about 37 miles apart 
kooistra said the bureau had received about a dozen protest 
calls and letters and decided to drop the ad this week because of 
the emotions it triggered 
the ad had been written in august well before the unrest 
erupted kooistra said 
we found out too late that the slogan is unfit he said

a judge in the nazi war crimes trial of john 
demjanjuk today reprimanded a defense attorney for comparing the 
proceedings to the dreyfus case in which a jewish officer in the 
french army was falsely convicted of treason 
presiding judge dov levine ordered defense attorney paul chumak 
to retract the statement and said no court in the world would 
allow such unfair claims to be made 
chumak refused repeatedly but when levine threatened to cite 
him for contempt of court both sides agreed to take the issue up 
at thursdays session 
chumak told the court during closing arguments that capt 
alfred dreyfus was convicted at the beginning of the century on 
the basis of false documents in a wave of antisemitism 
paralleling this with antiukrainianism this trial has all the 
earmarks of the dreyfus trial 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk is accused of being ivan the 
terrible a sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that killed 
850000 jews at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland in 
1942 and 1943 
demjanjuk 67 a retired ohio autoworker claims he is a victim 
of mistaken identity he says he served in the soviet army was 
captured by the germans in 1941 and remained in prisoner of war 
camps until 1943 
earlier chumak alleged that the soviet secret police forged a 
key piece of prosecution evidence as part of an elaborate 
conspiracy to discredit the israeli court and create a rift between 
ukrainians and jews in the soviet union 
chumak said the kgb forged the document demjanjuks alleged 
nazi identity card so it could accuse the court of injustice if 
demjanjuk were convicted 
levine responded sharply calling the theory distasteful 
the sovietsupplied document is the socalled trawniki card the 
prosecution alleged it was issued to demjanjuk at trawniki a nazi 
training camp for death camp guards near treblinka 
chumak also sought to discredit prosecution witness patricia 
smith one of several experts who testified to the authenticity of 
the card 
ms smith an anthropologist authenticated demjanjuks picture 
on the trawniki card by superimposing it on video footage of the 
defendant taken two years ago 
chumak called ms smiths method an unexplored field and 
said it was not accepted by the scientific community 
the defense is to wrap up its case thursday and a verdict from 
the threejudge panel is expected by april if convicted demjanjuk 
could face the death penalty

a federal court jury began deliberations today 
on whether six men and two women are members of the westies a gang 
of thugs that allegedly terrorized manhattans westside for two 
decades 
us district judge whitman knapp turned the case over to the 
jury following lastminute instructions on how to conduct their 
deliberations the trial began last october 
a 17count racketeering indictment charged the eight defendants 
were members of a criminal enterprise that seized control of the 
manhattan neighborhood once known as hells kitchen 20 years ago 
and held sway there through a series of murders and other crimes 
among the crimes allegedly committed to further the westiess 
goals were eight murders three attempted murders and five murder 
plots according to the indictment 
the indictment also listed 10 alleged coconspirators who had 
been killed before the charges were brought in march 
prosecutors mary lee warren and david brodsky claimed the 
westies had dismembered some victims bodies to enhance their 
reputation and eliminate competitors 
the government also claimed the westies forged an alliance with 
the gambino organized crime family said to be the nations most 
powerful and even shot a labor leader as a favor to reputed 
gambino boss john gotti 
but lawyers for reputed westies boss james coonan and his seven 
codefendants have denied the existence of the westies as an 
organization 
even government witnesses have conceded the name westies was 
created by the police and news media to describe a group of mainly 
irishamerican hoodlums 
the defense also attacked the credibility of those prosecution 
witnesses admitted former gang members who turned informants in a 
bid for leniency coonans attorney gerald shargel claimed all 
were unreliable because they were criminals seeking to cut a deal 
with the government

george bush and michael dukakis today 
pointed their campaigns southward after decisive new hampshire 
victories and bob dole promised to counterattack unless the vice 
president stops distorting the dole record bush denied he had 
done anything wrong 
richard gephardt who finished second to dukakis said he was in 
the race to stay however sen paul simon of illinois third among 
democrats in new hampshire after finishing second in iowa said he 
will have to drop out unless he can win next week in either south 
dakota or minnesota former arizona gov bruce babbitt said he had 
a divided mind about whether to continue but that jesse jackson 
had already asked for his support if he should drop out 
dole the big republican winner in iowa last week said bushs 
comeback victory in new hampshire was at least partly due to bush 
tv commercials that dole said distorted his record 
im going to try to go out and straighten it out he said at 
the manchester nh airport before flying back to washington 
im not going to run from it im not known for running from a 
fight 
bush who returned to washington tuesday night was reluctant to 
talk about doles accusation however when questioned during a 
brief exchange with reporters today he replied i think i said 
it wasnt true but ill be glad to say that 
you all want me to talk about sen dole i want to talk about 
the issues bush said im not going to dwell on it you see i 
dont want to be drawn into something like that 
bush added people in new hampshire like clean campaigns and 
they endorsed me overwhelmingly 
tuesday night dole had accused bush of lying about my 
record 
bush asked about that in an interview taped for cbstv today 
said im sorry he feels that way 
were you lying bush was asked 
no he answered quietly 
bush won 38 percent of the republican vote and 11 delegates to 
the gop convention in complete returns dole had 29 percent of 
the vote and seven delegates they were followed by rep jack kemp 
of new york former delaware gov pete du pont and former 
television evangelist pat robertson 
dukakis lived up to expectations by carrying his neighboring 
state by 16 percentage points over rep gephardt of missouri last 
weeks winner in iowa 
the turnout was a record 154012 republican voters and 119041 
democrats for a total of 273053 compared with 261243 in 1980 
this years figure was estimated to represent a bit less than half 
the states registered voters 
in other comments today 
dukakis who won by a big margin in a state bordering 
massachusetts where he is the governor said on abctv that he can 
also do well in the south which dominates the super tuesday 
primaries on march 8 people in the south arent voting for a zip 
code theyre voting for the president of the united states he 
said 
simon said on nbctv he would have to win next week 
otherwise im going to have to withdraw you just cant 
continue to run second and third 
gephardt said on abc that whoever remains in the race he 
himself will do well because were connecting with the voters on 
my ideas 
rep jack kemp of new york who beat out former television 
evangelist pat robertson and former delaware gov pete du pont for 
third place among the republicans said his showing proved his 
standing among the conservatives who form the base for himself du 
pont and robertson 
robertson on the other hand said this was a small spread 
between jack and me he added new england is not my natural 
constituency going into the south its a different ball 
game 
on to the south where were going to rise again exclaimed 
a euphoric bush late tuesday night he won a solid victory after 
seeing his earlier 20point lead in the polls melt in new hampshire 
after his embarrassing thirdplace finish in iowa behind dole and 
robertson 
for all the attention they got granite state voters managed to 
keep the presidential races in both parties in turmoil offering 
just enough support to alsorans to give them an excuse to struggle 
on toward super tuesday with its enormous 20state risks and 
rewards 
among the republicans kemp finished third with 13 percent and 
three delegates du pont edged out robertson 10 percent to 9 
percent du ponts total was high enough to win two delegates 
robertson got none 
in the delegate totals after bushs 61 came dole with 42 kemp 
with 35 and du pont with two the winning republican needs 1139 
delegates 
among the democrats after dukakis with 36 percent of the vote 
and nine delegates came gephardt with 20 percent and six delegates 
and simon with 17 percent and three delegates 
the other democratic finishers jackson with 8 percent sen 
albert gore jr 7 percent babbitt 5 percent and gary hart 4 
percent didnt do well enough to pick up any delegates 
in the delegate totals after dukakis 445 came gephardt with 
39 and simon with 33 the victorious democrat needs 2082 delegates 
for the nomination 
though he got no delegates jackson said he was happy because 
in iowa and new hampshire we proved we could broaden our base 
asked how he expected to do in the south he said i expect to 
win 
bush was exultant at his showing quoting mark twain he said 
reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated 
dukakis belittled gores regional strategy 
tomorrow we head south said the massachusetts governor 
i dont have a southern strategy he said i dont have a 
northern strategy or a western strategy i have an american 
strategy 
six states will vote before super tuesday but it was clear 
tuesday night that the campaigns were looking ahead to march 8 when 
20 states on the democratic side and 16 on the republican will 
offer the biggest oneday delegate prize of the campaign 
minnesota and south dakota take the spotlight next republicans 
and democrats hold caucuses in minnesota and primaries in south 
dakota next tuesday 
in the new hampshire democratic primary gephardt and simon 
fighting for democratic runnerup were also in a battle for money 
both campaigns are in financial trouble and needed a secondplace 
finish to keep contributions coming in 
with a first in iowa and a second in new hampshire gephardt was 
able to claim im in good shape 
south carolinas republican primary is saturday march 5 three 
days before super tuesday

time than his rivals in new hampshire watched the returns from

republican presidential primary

holding presidential contests on super tuesday march 8 
the vice presidents strong new hampshire showing tuesday 
followed his third place finish in iowa behind dole and pat 
robertson 
bush today steadfastly refused to discuss doles charge that the 
vice president had made false statements about the kansas senators 
record on such issues as the budget deficit and taxes 
you all want me to talk about sen dole i want to talk about 
the issues bush said you want to talk about history i want 
to talk about the future 
im not going to dwell on it you see i dont want to be 
drawn into something like that the vice president said 
bush added people in new hampshire like clean campaigns and 
they endorsed me overwhelmingly 
the system worked you can take them in the chin you can get 
up and you can fight again he said so now go on to super 
tuesday were going to fight hard were going to take nothing for 
granted were going to take a positive message a message that 
was good in new hampshire and is just as good elsewhere 
were moving into a new dimension now said lee atwater 
bushs national campaign manager the next big contest is super 
tuesday seventy percent of the delegates you need to get the 
nomination are going to be chosen that one night 
atwater said that whoever walks out of the super tuesday 
contests with the lions share of the delegates will win the 
republican nomination 
george bush has got a 31 lead on delegates now atwater 
said hes going to keep a 31 lead in delegates 
bush told several hundred supporters jammed into a hotel 
ballroom that you havent chosen a man youve chosen a course 
to expand our prosperity to see that it touches every hamlet 
youve chosen to back a strong america an america strong 
enough to bring peace to the entire world he added 
bush said things had dramatically turned around in the last two 
days of the campaign and that he did a better job in getting his 
message out he also flew in a conservative hero former sen barry 
goldwater of arizona to help him gain votes 
elections hinge on two things the candidates and the 
issues said atwater we had the best candidate we had the 
only candidate talking about issues this leaves dole as a loser 
here but i certainly wouldnt get overconfident weve got a long 
campaign ahead of us

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
feb 10 
the knoxville tenn newssentinel on navy mothers 
call it outmoded thinking if you will but we find it disturbing 
that a large percentage of women in the us navy who have babies 
are unmarried 
of 789 activeduty women who used the san diego naval hospital 
for childbirth from july 1986 through may 1987 323 were unmarried 
of the latter 69 percent elected to stay in the navy 
a fouroutof10 illegitimacy rate may not be considered 
astonishing for some but the navy surely ought to hew to a higher 
standard 
this also is more than a moral issue pentagon officials ought 
to wonder what effect this situation might have on national 
security unwed pregnant sailors and mothers surely have more on 
their minds than defense of the nation

hannibal mo courierpost on the court ruling against the 
armys ban on homosexuals 
the court has the power and the authority at least until the 
ruling is appealed or overturned to direct the armed forces to 
admit homosexuals 
but the court would be hardpressed to enforce compliance with 
the spirit as well as the letter of the law 
its far too early to tell how the court ruling will affect the 
armed forces 
but we can say with reasonable certainty that if the armed 
forces do not want homosexuals they will find ways of forcing them 
out court order or no court order 
the great majority of americans still regard homosexuality with 
contempt and it takes more than a judicial order to change 
attitudes

the orange county calif register on postal service cutbacks 
in most businesses if one company announces it will shorten 
hours and cut back service its competitors leap into action 
trying to win over dissatisfied customers 
not so in the mail biz a legally protected monopoly for the 
us postal service who loses the letter writers as usual 
with the postal service starting to cut back hours and 
eliminate saturday window service and sunday mail pickups the 
time is right for congress to allow some semblance of competition 
for mail delivery 
the latest cutbacks in service are being blamed on budget cuts 
congress in december trimmed 125 billion from the postal 
services appropriation for 1988 and 1989 
the postal service which should not be dependent on the 
taxpayers at all is woefully unprepared for that reality 
forcing post office officials to sink or swim in competitive 
waters is the surest way to reform an otherwise highly inefficient 
monopoly

palm beach fla post on soviet withdrawal from afghanistan 
officials in washington are treating as a positive step the 
announcement of a tentative timetable for withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan it is and they should 
ever since he came to power in 1985 soviet party boss mikhail 
gorbachev has been sending signals that he would like to end his 
nations bloody and unsuccessful attempt to impose a puppet 
government on the afghans 
what makes the most recent statement important is that it 
contains dates full withdrawal over a 10month period beginning 
may 15 
the mood in washington was that while the administration would 
prefer to see all soviet troops withdrawn by the end of the year 
it should not throw up any roadblocks 
that is a sound decision

the asbury park nj press on pat robertson 
pat robertson has a long road ahead of him the dual nature of 
his background and candidacy can never be overlooked 
and while skeptics call him a preacher in politicians 
clothing his career suggests that he may be more like a 
politican in preachers clothing 
robertsons real challenge is to convince the mass of voters who 
are not christian fundamentalists that he would not allow his 
religious views to interfere with affairs of state while at the 
same time holding on to his invisible army 
but is america ready for a president with a pipeline to god 
as robertson boasts perhaps it is 
ronald reagan proved theres political capital to be mined on 
the religious right and like the president robertson does have a 
way with tv cameras

the spokesmanreview spokane wash on kurt waldheim 
austrian president kurt waldheim hopes to wipe away the past and 
trust that the world will forgive and forget his part in the dark 
history of world war ii germany 
his reasoning is threadbare that everyone who served in the war 
knew what was happening the deportations mass murders torture 
that he merely followed rather than gave orders 
to deduce that knowledge constitutes some kind of crime is 
simply not correct waldheim claims 
and he is right but while not a crime that knowledge coupled 
with his failure to act against those atrocities is a moral outrage 
after a fivemonth investigation an international panel of six 
historians decided to put aside a conclusion on waldheims moral 
responsibility for war crimes he had knowledge of as a lieutenant 
in the german army from 1942 to 1945 instead the historians let 
the facts speak for themselves with the world and history to pass 
judgment 
the facts speak loudly but waldheims lies cry out if his past 
is not something of which he is ashamed and afraid why is he 
weaving such a web of deceit 
if waldheim has his way the chapter on his involvement in world 
war ii atrocities is closed now he says he will not step down as 
austrias president and he shouldnt have to 
austria ought to pull the rug out from under him

lewiston maine daily sun on privatization of the postal 
service 
the push is on for privatizing the us postal service every 
time the postal service requests a hike in the price of stamps 
privatization proponents crawl out of the woodwork with renewed 
vigor 
sure the current operation has its drawbacks and the service is 
slow and unreliable at times the post office is a traditional 
favorite whipping boy for people carrying a grudge 
despite several well publicized success stories of the public 
sector saving money there are obvious limitations to privatization 
and the contracting out of public services 
some examples of gross abuse have occurred with defense 
contractors construction projects and in the health care industry 
as well 
moreover removing essential services such as the mail delivery 
from the public sector could decrease accountability 
with an annual budget of more than 30 billion the us postal 
service affects much of the nations business and is crucial to the 
economy as a whole 
free enterprise is great when applied correctly but it is not a 
panacea to provide the answers to all siutuations

port arthur texas news on ussoviet relations in the bering 
sea 
its still not clear whether soviet military personnel have been 
sneaking on to st lawrence island a desolate chunk of us soil 
in the bering sea but the possibility of these surreptitious 
visits cannot be discounted either 
st lawrence island is about 50 miles off the coast of mainland 
alaska but its only 37 miles off the mainland of the soviet union 
it is inhabited by 650 eskimos and recently some islanders have 
been finding sovietmade items on the island such as beer cans 
batteries a gas mask buoys with explosive charges pieces of 
soviet uniforms etc 
island residents also report seeing mysterious strangers some 
clad in wet suits and scuba gear who run off when encountered 
the official pentagon response is that the material is 
flotsam and jetsam washed ashore by ocean currents but that 
doesnt explain how some of it was found far inland or why it 
included items which dont float such as batteries 
the reagan administration should send a firm note to the soviet 
union stating that such adventures if they are occurring should 
cease immediately

the wichita kan eaglebeacon on paraguays election 
what do you do if you hold an election and nobody participates 
nobody that is but the person in power and a couple of toadies 
what you do is proclaim a great victory afterwards and say how 
democratic you are for letting people vote like that 
this is what happened in paraguay on sunday feb 14 when 
dictator gen alfredo stroessner swept to an eighth fiveyear term 
as president by a margin of more than 88 percent 
the free nations of the hemisphere should react to sundays 
fraudulent vote by declaring it to be just that and by reaching 
out as the united states already has done to the democratic 
opposition 
it is there that paraguays future lies not with an aged 
dictator so unsure of his own rule and so fearful of dissent that 
he must fix his periodic reelection

the woonsocket ri call on the iowa caucuses 
its remarkable that over 3000 newsmen and women spent hundreds 
of thousands of hours covering the iowa caucus and ended up shocked 
and surprised when pat robertson received substantially more 
support than vice president groege bush how can that be 
if there is a lesson in all of this it may be that robertson 
actually talked in detail about programs to deal with americas 
problems while other candidates merely said they were capable of 
waving magic wands we dont think voters believe in magic wands 
anymore 
perhaps others will now be forced to spell out their programs 
that would be refreshing we would like to know for example how 
they will solve the deficit question what they will do about the 
foreign trade imbalance how they will guarantee continued health 
for social security 
win or lose robertson may have forced this kind of approach on 
all candidates if so we owe him a considerable debt of gratitude

dukakis lacks national experience but he is an intelligent 
pragmatic and forceful governor he has effectively presided over 
massachusetts good economic fortune he is the top democratic

we believe the republican race comes down to bob dole and george

a man fired from a defense plant for 
harassing women stalked the company for six hours fatally shooting 
seven people and wounding four others as terrified employees hid 
under desks and in offices until he surrendered authorities said 
among the injured was a woman who spurned his attentions police 
said 
richard wade farley 39 of nearby san jose walked from the 
sprawling twostory esl corp building about 830 pm tuesday with 
his hands in the air he was quickly surrounded by three officers 
and taken to the santa clara county jail 
im not crazy i know i will die as a result of this the 
chief negotiator sunnyvale public safety lt rueben grijalva 
quoted the gunman as saying before the surrender 
daryl anderson an esl business analyst said she was in her 
secondfloor office about 230 pm when the gunman came down the 
hall firing shots she said bullets punctured her office door 
i was under my desk in the fetal position for six hours she 
said i figured there was a sniper in the building the worst 
part of all was being there all by myself in the dark all the time 
i thought he was right out there in the hall 
the bodies of two women and five men were found when police 
swept through the silicon valley building after the arrest said 
commander alex michaelis of the sunnyvale department of public 
safety 
after the incident police said five people were wounded but 
this morning lt tom moore reduced the number of injured to four 
adding he could not immediately explain the discrepancy 
police seized a rifle a shotgun 9mm and 380caliber handguns 
and two bandoliers of ammunition after the gunman left his hiding 
place in a secondfloor room 
grijalva said farley told him he invaded the building to wreck 
equipment 
esl or electromagnetic systems laboratories a subsidiary of 
trw inc was established in 1964 and specializes in electronic 
warfare systems for the navy most of them highly classified 
products include reconnaissance systems datacommunications 
systems computer simulation and image processing it employs about 
2200 people 
police said the gunman took no hostages but that many employees 
had to hide under desks or in locked rooms 
on the second floor the gunman met the woman who had spurned 
him 26yearold engineer laura black when she slammed an office 
door in his face he shot her through the door grijalva said he 
said farley told police he shot the others because he felt 
threatened by them 
at one point farley began crying when talking about his mother 
the lieutenant said 
black was wounded in the shoulder police said she was listed 
in stable condition at stanford university medical center after 
surgery 
farley had worked at esl as a computer software technician 
before he was fired two years ago after complaints that he sexually 
harassed black and other female employees said jean tuffley of 
the companys personnel department 
farley who lived by himself in a dilapidated bungalow 
allegedly followed black over four years and black had tried to 
obtain a restraining order to keep him away moore said 
it was described to me as a situation that had turned into 
harassment he had according to him given her a warning to 
return his attentions and she didnt heed the warning and he said 
this was his way of making a point said capt al scott 
near the esl building which is about 40 miles south of san 
francisco police found a motor home they believe was driven by the 
gunman inside officers found ammunition full cans of gasoline 
and other explosive material said scott 
at one point during the negotiations the gunman expressed a 
little remorse for his actions said moore 
it was not clear how many of his victims the gunman knew 
one of those killed was identified by company officials as 
lawrence j kane of san jose the rest were not identified this 
morning 
authorities today identified the injured in addition to black 
as richard townsley 44 in stable condition with a gunshot wound 
to the chest greg scott 39 in good condition with gunshot wounds 
to the forehead and body and pattie marcotte 41 was in surgery 
this morning to repair a broken elbow suffered as she fled

the new hampshire primary was a great 
triumph for two disparate groups the republican establishment and 
lovers of political chaos 
george bush the quintessential establishment candidate emerged 
from the ashes of iowa to regain the mantle of republican 
frontrunner but his victory brightened the hopes of those who 
cherish rousing political brawls and hope for at least one this 
year that goes all the way to the convention floor 
of course it is the democrats with their looser rules and lack 
of a clear leader who really provide hope for an open convention 
michael dukakis triumph put him temporarily atop the democratic 
field but none of the seven candidates has demonstrated national 
appeal 
and so its on to the south the candidates are all taking 
dead aim on the march 8 election day when most of the south and 
some key states outside will select enough delegates to settle the 
races in both parties 
but dont bet on a super tuesday resolution the big stakes 
1307 democratic delegates in 20 states and 700 republican in 16 
states may only confuse the contests rather than settle them 
you have to like bushs chances but both parties offer 
scenarios that argue for long hard fights 
two democrats without obvious appeal in dixie rep richard 
gephardt of missouri and dukakis split the two early events and 
now are confronted by sen albert gore jr of tennessee and jesse 
jackson on their own turf 
jackson finished fourth in iowa and new hampshire solid 
showings in two states which have very few minority voters who 
provide his base of support there is no reason to think that any 
of the other democrats can compete with jackson for the large black 
vote in the south 
as a tennessean who has positioned himself to the right of the 
rest of the democratic field gore has run a super tuesday strategy 
that will test a generationold political assumption that you 
cant win the nomination without competing in the early events 
i think super tuesday changes all the rules said gore 
its a completely new ball game 
its a dicey strategy but even if it falls short gore may get 
enough support on march 8 to establish his candidacy and perhaps 
leave jackson as the biggest winner of delegates that day 
then it would be on to the midwest for four democrats jackson 
dukakis gephardt and gore 
that prospect would delight republicans but they could be in a 
muddle of their own 
if the southern contest were bush versus sen bob dole the 
outcome would appear tilted in favor of the vice president who has 
a strong organization throughout the region a strong 
identification with president reagan and roots in the biggest plum 
of all texas 
but it wont be a twoman fight for the republicans rep jack 
kemp lives to fight on in the south and pat robertson will be 
battling on his home turf 
bush and dole are battling for the same voters while robertson 
has a constituency all his own many of them people activated 
politically by a desire to support the former evangelist 
republican rules make it almost impossible for the presidential 
race to go all the way to the convention in new orleans next 
august chances are better that two candidates or maybe even 
three will fight for the 175 delegates at stake in californias 
winnertakeall republican primary on june 7 but if there are 
three republicans battling for that delegation the field may be so 
split that even a california win would not put someone over the top 
all in all its a volatile mix on both sides on the morning 
after new hampshire a good bet is that super tuesday will settle 
nothing certainly among the democrats and the cry that night 
will be on to california by way of illinois new york

the chiefs of the republican and democratic 
national parties told congress wednesday that they support 
increasing the amount of federal money spent on presidential 
transitions 
the bill would increase to 35 million the government 
assistance that goes to a presidentelect to begin making 
arrangements for a new administration the original 1963 law 
provided 900000 which was increased to 2 million in 1976 
advocates have complained that 12 years of inflation have made that 
insufficient 
the scope and complexity of activity required for an efficient 
transition has increased significantly over the years paul kirk 
chairman of the democratic national committee told the senate 
governmental affairs committee 
he said new presidents must immediately begin filling more than 
3000 executive appointments and preparing a federal budget for 
presentation to congress within three months 
under the legislation the federal money would go to the major 
parties which would be reimbursed for transition tasks they 
perform both party leaders voiced approval of this mechanism 
frank fahrenkopf chairman of the republican national committee 
said the national parties have the facilities and equipment to do 
transition work efficiently and that the job would reinforce 
their traditional role of providing personnel and support for their 
candidates 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the committee said that 
even if the financing increase is approved the money provided 
might still be too low 
i wish we could say it will cover this thing he said i 
doubt that it will 
the legislation would require public disclosure of the sources 
and use of privately donated transition money and provide for 
reimbursement to each political party of up to 200000 for 
transition work performed before the general election

former israeli foreign minister abba eban met 
today with secretary of state george p shultz to discuss a new 
us initiative for mideast peace talks but cautioned against 
expecting too much from the american mediation effort 
eban told reporters after his 30minute meeting with shultz that 
one must not see too distant horizons for the plan shultz is 
taking to israeli jordanian and egyptian leaders later this month 
eban an ally of foreign minister shimon peres said he hoped 
shultz can overcome reservations expressed by prime minister 
yitzhak shamir about the us plan 
shamir is concerned that the proposals which reportedly call 
for talks to begin in april between israel and its arab neighbors 
on palestinian autonomy will force israel to cede land to the 
arabs 
the us plan which has not been made public envisions that 
negotiations on a final settlement for the territories that israel 
captured in the 1967 middle east war would begin in december 
the reagan administration is trying to set the basis for 
continued efforts by the next administration to advance the 
arabisraeli talks eban said 
as part of his efforts to obtain continuity and congressional 
approval for his ideas shultz will be meeting later in the day 
with members of the senate he held a similar meeting tuesday night 
with some 25 members of the house to outline his views 
shultzs activity came in response to two months of 
israelipalestinian violence in which at least 53 palestinians have 
been killed 
eban a former israeli ambassador to washington and head of the 
israeli parliaments foreign affairs and defense committee follows 
on the heels of ehud olmert another parliament member who met 
with shultz on sunday olmert is a close trusted friend of israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who faces opposition from shimon 
peres in the fractious coalition government 
olmert told shultz that shamir was concerned over the us 
proposal to set december as the date for talks on the future of the 
occupied territories shamir leader of the rightwing likud bloc 
is concerned that such talks would lead to demands for land 
concessions to the arabs 
likud is opposed to giving back any of the captured territories 
which it views as a biblical heritage and a strategic buffer zone 
between israel and its arab neighbors peres labor party is 
willing to relinquish some land for peace and supports an 
international conference to sponsor peace talks 
egypt and jordan said monday the united states should not 
advance interim solutions to the palestinian problem 
president hosni mubarak of egypt said we have taken the 
position that any plan must clearly include first an overall 
settlement of the problem and second an international conference 
as a framework without any attempt to outflank it 
prime minister zaid rifai of jordan who met in cairo on monday 
with mubarak said that jordan opposed partial solutions or 
projects for selfrule in the west bank and gaza jordan wants a 
final settlement through an international conference he added 
rifai reiterated jordans demand for a united nationssponsored 
international conference with the participation of the security 
councils five permanent members and all concerned parties 
including the palestine liberation organization 
shultz will visit israel jordan and egypt starting about feb 
25 some 24 hours after returning to washington from meetings in 
moscow 
while in moscow shultz is expected to sound out the soviets on 
their position regarding mideast peace talks 
privately israeli officials have suggested shultz might suggest 
to his counterpart edouard shevardnadze that the united states 
would do all it can to ease a soviet pullout from afghanistan in 
return for which the kremlin would ensure the support of its arab 
allies in the mideast for shultzs plan

the senate labor and human resources committee 
on wednesday approved a controversial bill that would require 
employers to provide health coverage to more than 20 million 
uninsured people 
the 106 vote came after nearly two hours of discussion ranging 
from denunciations of the insurance industry to a spirited debate 
over socialism and senators own health coverage 
nevertheless when it was all over sen edward kennedy the 
committee chairman was pleased 
weve got a very positive attitude here he said the 
health issues on the national agenda its going to be 
difficult for people to oppose this program 
the socalled minimum health bill sponsored by kennedy 
dmass would require employers to offer a minimum package that 
includes hospital care doctor care diagnostic and screening 
tests prenatal and wellbaby care and limited mental health 
treatment the policies would cap outofpocket catastrophic costs 
at 3000 
coverage would have to be offered to employees working 175 
hours a week or more and their dependents small family farms 
would be temporarily exempted from coverage requirements 
new businesses would be able to phase in coverage over two 
years and under an amendment adopted wednesday firms of five or 
fewer people would have five years to phase in benefits 
the congressional budget office estimates the bill would cover 
up to 23 million of an estimated 37 million people without 
insurance the new coverage would cost about 27 billion cbo said 
but it would be offset by about 12 billion in savings on 
administrative costs charity care and other outlays 
sen orrin hatch rutah said the kennedy plan taxes americans 
indirectly through businesses and called it socialism pure and 
simple 
a frustrated sen tom harkin diowa responded that 
congressional medical services all free and conveniently located 
in the capitol are the most socialized medicine in america 
his voice rising harkin continued every senator takes part 
in it every house member takes part in it but will they vote it 
for everyone else in america no 
hatch equally frustrated said he would vote to end the free 
care for members of congress but declined to stop his own visits 
immediately on principle 
were a bunch of hypocrites hatch conceded he added a 
moment later i have to admit i use it but i dont use it as 
much as most people i think 
hatch called the kennedy bill a 30 billion solution to an 8 
billion problem and likened it to using a sledge hammer to crack 
an egg 
health and human services secretary otis bowen in a letter 
tuesday to kennedy also criticized the scope of the proposal he 
said it would impose an unduly intrusive and centralist solution 
one wholly disproportionate to the dimensions of the problem being 
addressed 
bowen said the problem is limited in scope and could be 
resolved with sharply focused plans at the state level 
the only state with compulsory employersponsored health 
insurance is hawaii sen spark matsunaga dhawaii said 13 
percent of hawaiians were uninsured before the plan compared to 5 
percent now coverage requirements are more extensive than the 
kennedy bill he said 
none of the businesses are complaining businesses are 
prospering as usual matsunaga said its working beautifully 
i think it can work nationally 
several senators criticized the insurance industry and small 
business groups for failing to help develop a consensus approach to 
closing the health insurance gap 
if the insurance industry refuses to participate itll be 
the government that does the job then theyll come along and say 
let us in let us in said sen lowell weicker rconn as for 
small business they dont want any bill period over and out

attorney general edwin meese iii on wednesday 
made his seventh appearance before the grand jury investigating the 
irancontra affair presumably for more questioning about his 1986 
weekend probe of the armsforhostages deals 
among other things the grand jury impaneled early last year by 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh is believed to be focusing on 
meeses nov 2223 1986 investigation that uncovered the diversion 
of armssale profits to the nicraguan rebels 
in recent weeks the grand jury has heard testimony by assistant 
attorney general william bradford reynolds who found a memo 
revealing the diversion in national security council files and 
assistant attorney general charles j cooper another member of the 
team 
former white house chief of staff donald t regan who was 
present when president reagan ordered meese to conduct the 
investigation and also when the attorney general reported his 
findings has testified recently 
meese also has testified six other times before a different 
grand jury investigating his financial dealings with a former 
officer of the scandalplagued wedtech corp 
the attorney general has refused to comment on his grand jury 
appearances but the justice department says he is cooperating with 
the investigation and is not a target of walshs probe 
meeses investigation was criticized by congressional committees 
that held hearings last summer on the irancontra affair the 
panels faulted meese for not recruiting justice department lawyers 
with more experience investigating criminal cases and for failing 
to take notes during interviews with top administration officials 
after he learned about the diversion 
the congressional committees said meeses failure to secure 
national security council files allowed documents to be shredded by 
thennational security adviser john m poindexter nsc aide lt 
col oliver l north and others 
poindexter resigned and north was fired after meese announced 
that armssale profits had been diverted to the contra rebels 
poindexter and north are targets of the walshs investigation 
indictments are expected to be returned in the coming weeks

them they stopped and drove back only to find higgins station 
wagon abandoned goksel said

in lebanon said higgins was kidnapped by three gunmen driving a 
mercedes car gurdus did not give the source of his information 
the gunmen stopped higgins vehicle forced him to board their 
car and speeded off toward the village of shabrikha gurdus said on 
israel radio

col jeanclaude paul whom a miami 
businessman called the main cocaine trafficker in haiti runs an 
army unit that is quartered at the national palace and known as the 
countrys most brutal 
a western diplomat said paul is very popular with his troops 
he likes to spread money around to them and commands them 
directly there is no normal chain of command 
the palaces latest occupant president leslie manigat promised 
in his inaugural speech feb 7 to stop drug trafficking in his 
impoverished caribbean nation 
manigat mentioned no names and was escorted into the palace 
after the address by military guards including paul who carried 
an uzi submachine gun his dessalines battalion barracks are 
attached to the rear of the palace 
before the inauguration paul often served as unofficial 
bodyguard to lt gen henri namphy and gen williams regala they 
were the military members on of the threeman provisional junta 
that ruled for two years after dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled 
the country feb 7 1986 
paul is a stocky man of medium height about 40 who customarily 
wears a ring necklace and heavy bracelet of gold except for his 
role as informal bodyguard for which he equips himself with an uzi 
and holstered colt 45 he seldom appears in public 
osvaldo quintana a 35yearold businessman told reporters 
monday in miami that he arranged a cocaine shipment with paul 
using an airstrip on the colonels ranch to smuggle the drugs to 
florida via the bahamas 
he said he knew of involvement by higher haitian officials 
extending up to the junta but would not give names 
his lawyer ellis rubin said he wanted quintana to testify 
before the senate committee investigating alleged drug smuggling by 
gen manuel antonio noriega panamas military commander and the 
power behind his countrys government 
rubin said his client had testified before a federal grand jury 
in miami investigating illegal drug activity in haiti 
quintana said he ran a seafood operation until becoming involved 
in smuggling in august 1986 he met paul in december of that year 
and arranged for 220 pounds of cocaine to be shipped to the united 
states the miami man said 
we flew out of his own personal ranch in haiti quintana 
told the news conference 
no one in haiti has publicly accused paul of drug trafficking 
although rumors of his involvement are rife in diplomatic circles 
and among retired military officers 
a us diplomat would not confirm or deny reports of pauls 
connection with drug trafficking but acknowledged the airstrip 
existed he described it as a funnylooking highway that starts 
nowhere and ends nowhere near the border with the dominican 
republic which shares the island of hispaniola with haiti 
another western diplomat said paul owns a ranch equipped with an 
asphalt landing strip near thomazeau about 20 miles east of 
portauprince he said it is believed the ranch on the culdesac 
plain near the frontier once belonged to duvalier 
all the diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the 700man dessalines battalion largest unit in haitis 
6000man army is also known as the most violent men wearing the 
blue dessalines shoulder patch killed most of the nearly 40 
civilians shot by soldiers during antigovernment strikes and 
protests in 1987 
on the day of the aborted election nov 29 when thugs with guns 
and machetes killed at least 34 people and wounded 75 western 
reporters and election observers saw truckloads of dessalines 
soldiers stand by without intervening 
gen carl nicolas the army chief of staff refused a request by 
the associated press for an interview with paul 
anaise chavenet spokeswoman for the information ministry said 
tuesday the government will not give an opinion on this affair 
as long as it is not officially informed by us officials 
through the ministry of foreign affairs 
on monday ms chavenet said of paul i personally think that 
he is being singled out for attack like noriega in panama 
president manigat has pledged to fight drug trafficking i dont 
know how he feels about col paul 
asked during a recent interview at his home about reports of 
drug smuggling by the army manigat said i cant base my 
judgment on rumors 
the western diplomat who mentioned pauls popularity with his 
men said the dessalines battalion is the only unit really feared 
here 
he said duvalier created the elite 300man leopards battalion 
in the early 1980s to check the power of pauls unit the leopards 
the 100man navy the 100man air force and the 1000man 
presidential guard have the reputation of being more humane and 
professional 
after duvalier fled the diplomat said paul recruited about 100 
members of the dictators tonton macoute private militia which 
terrorized haiti during 29 years of duvalier family rule

riots in the occupied lands are only an 
hours drive from tel aviv but there are no outward signs that the 
unrest is dampening spirits in israels entertainment capital 
on a recent saturday night young couples crowded into the 
popular cherrys cafe and the decibels were as deadly as ever at 
the cafe dan discotheque which caters to the punk rock crowd 
peoples daytoday life is not affected unless they have 
arabs working for them i think a lot of people ignore the trouble 
because it seems far away said rickie gal a rock singer whose 
blond hair was streaked with a slash of red 
but sitting in a cafe on dizengoff street the center of tel 
avivs night life ms gal said she was recording her first 
political song to protest the violence it says yes enough 
war and no to hate and the use of force 
because israel is about the size of rhode island little happens 
that is geographically remote tel aviv is only 50 miles from the 
gaza strip and 30 miles from nablus the west banks largest city 
the psychological distance is much greater because a large 
percentage of israelis rarely if ever visit the occupied lands 
unless they are forced to by an army callup 
in contrast jeruslemarea houses have had picture windows and 
windshields smashed by rioters and several private cars have been 
torched 
in neighborhood meetings jewish residents have warned they will 
use guns if necessary to defend their homes if police are unable to 
do so 
israelis in the tel aviv metropolitan area which has 15 
million jews and about 10000 arabs say they feel much less 
threatened than israelis who live 45 minutes away in jerusalem 
which borders the west bank and has a onethird arab population 
in tel aviv being so fully jewish you never really feel 
events like this the way you do in jerusalem there is a different 
feeling in the air people go on with their life as usual said 
benny cohen a spokesman for the city 
he said the mood was summed up in a current pop song by army 
singers from the southern command band titled tel aviv is not 
worried 
people are very aware of the situation and caught up in it 
but jerusalem is a more political city by nature the ratio of 
politics to barroom conversations is lower in tel aviv than in 
jerusalem said zeev chavets an israeli author and immigrant 
from pontiac mich 
tel aviv residents have been called to reserve duty in the 
occupied areas just like other israelis they employ some of the 
40000 arabs who provide menial labor for tel aviv hotels 
restaurants construction sites and factories 
frequent arab strikes have affected city garbage collection 
more than half the 350 arabs stayed home and several hundred arab 
restaurant workers fled tel avivs restaurant district this week

west germanys main opposition party 
pressured the government wednesday to follow moscows lead and 
scrap some nuclear missiles before a ussoviet missile treaty 
goes into effect 
hermann scheer disarmament expert for the opposition social 
democrats said chancellor helmut kohl should respond to the early 
soviet missile reductions by dismantling west germanys 72 pershing 
1a missiles 
such a reaction would be equal to developing trust in 
disarmament which the leadership in east berlin has been working 
toward with the soviets scheer speaking on behalf of the party 
told reporters 
east germanys staterun news agency adn reported tuesday that 
the soviet union had dismantled ss12 nuclear missiles in waren an 
east german site about 90 miles northwest of berlin 
the ss12s are included in a ussoviet agreement to eliminate 
the superpowers medium and shorterrange missiles 
kohl announced before the superpower pact was signed that west 
germany would scrap its pershing 1a missiles as part of a new 
treaty the pershing 1a missiles are owned by west germany but the 
united states controls the rockets nuclear warheads 
on wednesday east german newspapers printed photos of 
dismantled missiles and hailed the soviet preparations for removing 
the ss12s before the treaty is ratified 
soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from east 
germany the communist partys official newspaper new germany 
said in a banner headline 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed 
the treaty in washington last december the agreement stipulates 
that the soviets shorterrange missiles in east germany and in 
czechoslovakia are to be removed within 18 months and mediumrange 
us and soviet missiles within three years 
three senate committees are debating the treaty and ratification 
may come during the summer the supreme soviet the soviet unions 
parliament is expected to approve the accord 
in washington the state department had no immediate reaction to 
the report but a us official who demanded anonymity said the 
soviets were free to remove their missiles before the treaty takes 
effect 
the official said us inspectors will go to east germany and 
all other soviet missile sites to verify compliance with the treaty 
if it is ratified 
adn did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when 
they would be returned to the soviet union only that soviet 
soldiers are making the last preparations to return their ss12 
rockets 
with this step we can make an important contribution toward 
disarmament even before the treaty between the united states and 
the soviet union is ratified adn wrote 
east german leader erich honecker said in january that soviet 
intermediaterange rockets based in his country could be removed 
ahead of schedule but at the time gave no specific timetable 
according to figures released after the treaty was signed 22 
rockets 12 launchers nine transport vehicles and seven practice 
missiles were stationed at waren which has the largest numbers of 
ss12s in east germany there are three other ss12 sites in the 
country 
the soviet union also has shorterrange ss23 nuclear missiles 
based in east germany

the president and four other officials 
of an engineering firm have resigned in the wake of allegations 
that one of the executives improperly tried to influence a federal 
safety agency 
the allegations stem from a letter written in december by fred 
w graham rust engineering cos manager of safety and security 
to an official of the occupational safety and health 
administration in which graham offered to testify favorably about 
the agency before a congressional committee 
in return graham wrote he sought oshas agreement to 
reasonable penalties against rust engineering based in 
birmingham ala for safety violations at bridgeports 
garbagetoenergy plant 
graham was one of the five who resigned tuesday said company 
spokeswoman sherry cook 
rust is building the 200 million plant in bridgeport last

americans have never been healthier but they feel 
worse and worse a doctor says 
dr arthur j barsky calls this the paradox of health the 
nations collective health has improved dramatically over the past 
30 years yet people report increasingly high rates of disability 
and a general dissatisfaction with their health 
barsky a psychiatrist at massachusetts general hospital blames 
this on several factors including peoples obsession with diet and 
exercise and their unrealistic expectations of what medicine can do 
for them 
writing in thursdays new england journal of medicine barsky 
noted that the life expectancy of a child born in 1984 was 75 
years in 1900 it was 47 since 1970 alone the life expectancy 
has increased by four years 
however surveys show that people report twice as many episodes 
of disabling illness now than they did in the 1920s before the 
introduction of antibiotics in the 1970s 61 percent of americans 
said they were satisfied with their health a decade later this 
had fallen to 55 percent 
our subjective feeling of healthiness and physical wellbeing 
has decreased even though there have been major advances in our 
actual objective health status barsky wrote 
one reason is medicines conquest of diseases that kill quickly 
it lets people grow old so they die with diseases that linger 
people who are saved from pneumonia and tuberculosis live long 
enough to be afflicted with arthritis and diabetes 
thus we live longer but a greater proportion of our life is 
spent in ill health he wrote 
among other factors cited by barsky 
peoples fascination with diet exercise and healthy living 
means they spend more time thinking about their bodies this erodes 
their sense of wellbeing because they are more negative about 
their health when they dwell on it 
the proliferation of doityourself diagnostic kits health 
magazines fat farms and other health products makes people more 
conscious of trivial symptoms every twinge and ache becomes the 
sign of a horrifying disease this along with news media 
exaggeration of such rare health problems as toxic shock syndrome 
induces a cultural climate of alarm and hypochondria undermining 
feelings of wellbeing 
people go to the doctor twice as often as they did 50 years 
ago frequently they seek help for such minor complaints as sore 
muscles colds and upset stomaches this medicalization of daily 
life leads people to think that all of their discomforts are 
curable and they are disappointed when they are not

northern ireland police wednesday announced a 
disciplinary inquiry against officers involved in the killing of 
six unarmed men in the province in three incidents in late 1982 
the investigation headed by charles kelly chief constable of 
the staffordshire force will delve into a controversy that has 
resurfaced this year to embarrass the british government and 
seriously damage its relations with ireland 
the royal ulster constabulary northern irelands police force 
said the inquiry was ordered by its chief constable sir john 
hermon it did not say how many officers would be investigated or 
what penalties they might face 
the announcement came three weeks after the government disclosed 
that evidence had emerged of perjury and subversion of justice in 
an alleged coverup of the circumstances of the shootings 
on jan 25 the government said it would not prosecute the 
police officers involved provoking angry reactions from dublin as 
well as british opposition politicians 
the decision to take disciplinary action was seen as an attempt 
to placate the irish government while the opposition labor party 
said it confirmed longstanding allegations of police misconduct in 
northern ireland 
this is perhaps one of the most serious and grave statements 
we have heard about the british security forces in northern 
ireland said kevin mcnamara labors spokesman on northern 
ireland in a house of commons debate 
northern ireland secretary tom king told parliament 
undoubtedly serious mistakes were made which have damaged the 
reputation of the ruc 
he said the issues go to the heart of the problems faced by a 
police force using the normal processes of law while fighting a 
ruthless and vicious terrorist enemy 
the shootings were investigated for two years by john stalker 
then assistant chief constable of manchester 
he found that five deaths occurred when police in separate 
incidents fired on moving cars the occupants were unarmed but 
were acknowledged by their organizations as guerrillas the sixth 
victim was a teenager who stumbled on a guerrilla explosives 
hideout that was under police surveillance and was shot in 
stillunexplained circumstances 
stalker this month published a book claiming he was dumped from 
the inquiry because his findings threatened to implicate senior ruc 
officers in murder 
king said the inquiry would determine whether to bring 
disciplinary action against officers up to the rank of chief 
superintendent the northern ireland police authority a 
policecivilian watchdog body would have to decide whether more 
senior officers should be disciplined he said 
king also outlined structural changes in the ruc prompted by the 
lessons of the 1982 shootings 
in dublin in a parliamentary debate on the worsening state of 
angloirish relations irish prime minister charles haughey said 
recent controversies concerning northern ireland had aroused 
strong feelings of irish public opinion 
besides the 1982 shootings he cited 
the british appeals courts refusal jan 28 to grant a retrial 
to six irishmen serving life sentences for twin bomb attacks that 
killed 21 people in 1974 the six claim they are innocent and were 
convicted on faulty forensic evidence and confessions they say were 
beaten out of them 
britains refusal to fulfill conditions set down by ireland 
for the extradition of irish terrorist suspects to british police 
under a new extradition treaty that took effect dec 1 
the british governments announcement tuesday that it will 
make its controversial prevention of terrorism act a permanent law 
rather than requiring annual parliamentary renewal 
the 13yearold act empowers police to hold terrorism suspects 
for up to seven days without charging them or giving them access to 
a lawyer

bob dole on wednesday portrayed george bush 
and his aides as the hatchetmen of the gop presidential campaign 
with all the axes in town swinging them in every state 
dole promised to swing back if attacked again 
youre seeing a mean george bush you ought to take a look at 
some of the things they have been doing and saying dole declared 
as he tried to rebound from his stinging defeat at bushs hands in 
new hampshire on tuesday 
the kansas senator said he had been too soft on bush and had 
erred in the final days of the campaign by not responding to 
negative ads run by the vice presidents campaign 
bush meanwhile denied he had done anything wrong 
im not going to dwell on it you see i dont want to be 
drawn into something like that the vice president said to 
reporters people in new hampshire like clean campaigns and they 
endorsed me overwhelmingly 
sticking with his contention that the bush ads were false dole 
said he would not make the same mistake again he was careful to 
say that his aides would do the heavy lifting in the 
counterattacks which were already under way 
the problem with george bush is that he hasnt got a record 
dole campaign manager bill brock told reporters on the campaign 
plane from new hampshire if somebody can tell me what he has 
done in the last seven years ill buy somebody a steak 
brock however said dole officials would not distort the record 
as they said bush had done we dont have to wallow in the mud 
with them to answer their charges he said 
dole himself did try to stay away from a role in the 
counterattacking which is a sensitive subject in light of his 
reputation as once the toughest hatchetman of the gop asked if the 
new tactics threaten to revive that old image dole said it is the 
bush campaign that faces the image problem 
they have all the axes in town they seem to be swinging them 
in every state he said 
dole pointed to an ad run by the bush campaign in new hampshire 
that accused him of straddling the issues of taxes an oil import 
fee and the mediumrange missile treaty and brock reminded 
reporters that bushs iowa campaign manager had attacked dole for 
cronyism and meanspiritedness and raised questions about 
his wifes blind trust 
dole blamed part of his new hampshire problem on the surge of 
expectations that built after he trounced bush in the iowa caucuses 
on feb 8 
if expectations hadnt gotten so good it would have been a 
victory today dole told reporters at the airport in washington 
we didnt win but thats only one step along the way were 
going to south dakota and minnesota 
dole talked with reporters on the campaign plane as it flew from 
manchester to washington where dole spent the day in meetings and 
in a senate debate on campaign financing he was asked if he had 
been too soft on bush 
probably dole replied 
should he have fired back at bush 
yes thats my guess he said i think we sat on our hands 
for three days 
as for the dispute distorted ads dole said at the manchester 
airport im not going to run from it im not known for running 
from a fight 
i never said i was going to raise your taxes i didnt say i 
was advocating a 10abarrel import fee but thats what bushs 
ads say and they are not true 
it was brock who laid out the new tactics for the dole campaign 
against possible future bush attacks 
when he does it from now on were going to respond very very 
forcefully brock said on the plane were tired of it were 
sick to the gills of this type of tactic 
george campaign on your own brock lectured bush via the 
media earn it on your own dont try to put somebody else down

gary dotson the convicted rapist who was 
freed from prison in 1985 after his alleged victim recanted on 
wednesday was ordered behind bars for at least six months for 
violating the conditions of his parole 
the illinois prisoner review board rejected dotsons plea for 
another chance and ruled that he had violated the terms of parole 
for failing to report to his parole officer last dec 24 
the board ordered dotson held in state prison until aug 16 
when he will be eligible for parole again and may be released from 
prison if he complies with conditions set by the board said nic 
howell a spokesman for the state department of corrections 
dotson was ordered by the board to undergo a substance abuse 
treatment program while in prison 
dotsons case drew national attention when cathleen crowell 
webb now a new hampshire homemaker recanted her testimony that 
dotson had raped her when she was a suburban teenager 
after three days of hearings in 1985 gov james r thompson 
commuted dotsons sentence of 25 to 50 years to the six years he 
had served the governor did not pardon dotson saying he did not 
believe the recantation 
since then dotson has had numerous scrapes with the law which 
under the goodconduct terms of his commutation could result in him 
being ordered to serve out the remainder of his sentence 
dotson was imprisoned last year for violating his parole terms 
by being convicted on drunken driving charges thompson freed 
dotson a second time when he modified his 1985 commutation order to 
allow dotson out on dec 24 in what the governor called a 
lastchance deal 
two days later dotson was arrested after a bar fight in 
suburban calumet city prosecutors later dropped battery charges in 
that incident but dotson remained in jail on a parole hold 
dotson told the review board during a hearing tuesday that he is 
an alcoholic and needed treatment 
the ruling disappointed dotsons family 
i just dont understand why theyve got to keep him in jail 
said laura dotson one of his five sisters why cant they just 
put him in a halfway house or something hes been in jail long 
enough for something he didnt do we want him in a rehab but not 
in jail

nine out of 10 american hospitals have policies 
restricting smoking and a growing number are banning smoking from 
their premises entirely according to a study released wednesday 
more than half the surveyed hospitals that restrict or ban 
smoking said they had a moral responsibility to do so according to 
stuart a wesbury jr president of the chicagobased american 
college of healthcare executives 
healthcare executives are taking seriously their role in 
promoting wellness wesbury said at a news conference where he 
released results of the colleges survey of 770 hospitals 
the number of respondents who report they have banned smoking 
is extremely impressive when one considers the nature of a 
hospital wesbury said its not easy to simply say no 
smoking with the number of people many of them under tremendous 
stress who use the facility each day as patients or visitors 
of the 90 percent of respondents with smoking policies in effect 
last year 8 percent had outright bans on smoking by employees 
physicians patients and visitors the college found 
in 1981 a survey of more than 3000 hospitals by the american 
hospital association found maybe one or two in the country with 
outright bans on smoking said lynn jones manager of 
worksitehealth promotion for that chicagobased organization 
typical of those with smoking bans is st cloud hospital of st 
cloud minn a 489bed hospital that banned smoking last november 
sister paul revier organizer of its smokefree policy said 
exceptions are made for patients in the hospitals 
chemicaldependency and psychiatric wards and for patients who 
obtain written permission to smoke from a doctor 
fewer than 10 such physician orders have been written since the 
policy went into effect she said 
there had been no problems with employee smoking sister paul 
said adding she did not expect any to arise the hospital offered 
its employees educational programs and stopsmoking classes for a 
year before the ban began she said 
people are in a sense embarrassed to smoke among other 
employees she said 
john frobenius the hospital president said st clouds 
smokefree policy had created less of a stir than he had expected 
although he said one woman chose to have her baby at another 
hospital rather than give up smoking during her stay 
the university of chicago medical center will go smokefree on 
april 1 said kenneth bloem executive vice president of the 
654bed complex which includes three hospitals and 100 outpatient 
clinics 
this is the second phase of a longterm policy to eliminate 
smoking from the center altogether bloem said 
we have looked at smoking as a major publichealth problem and 
see this as an opportunity for our institutions to promote the 
health of patients staff and visitors as well as maintaining the 
health of our patients he said

federal authorities are seeking a fugitive who 
fled to greece after allegedly stealing three valuable paintings 
from a wealthy family and arranging to have them sold by a new york 
auction house 
the paintings were recovered after they were auctioned but 
before they were shipped to the buyers 
a federal grand jury last week indicted john zentefis a former 
foreman at a chicago storage warehouse in the thefts from heiress 
mary bates harrington 
the paintings summer montclair by george inness end of 
day by jean c cazin and river landscape by alexander h 
wyant were once owned by chicago coal magnate george bates 
harrington and his wife sophia 
harrington died in 1960 and his wife died in 1963 the paintings 
were inherited by ms harrington who placed them in storage at a 
federal moving and storage co warehouse in chicago 
zentefis worked at warehouse according to the indictment in 
1979 federal moving and storage went bankrupt and the boxes were 
supposed to be transferred to the warehouse of a different company 
in 1984 a friend of the harrington family noticed that 
summer montclair a 100yearold landscape painting had been 
listed in a circular sent out by sothebys the wellknown auction 
house the fbi was notified and agent robert spiel was dispatched 
to new york according to the indictment 
spiel found that summer montclair had been auctioned to an 
unidentified london man for 90750 the other two paintings had 
been sold to other buyers for a total of 4375 
zentefis received 76000 and fled to greece the indictment 
alleged while sothebys kept the rest of the money as a commission 
spiel confiscated the still unshipped art works and brought them 
back to chicago where the paintings are now being held in storage 
by the art institute of chicago 
assistant us attorney alex vesselinovitch began a grand jury 
investigation and the family hired attorney gordon nash to sort out 
the affair 
eventually sothebys paid back the disgruntled purchasers of 
the works which a cook county judge said belong to ms harrington

housing construction suffered a second 
consecutive monthly decline in january dipping to the weakest pace 
since the end of the last recession the government reported 
wednesday 
the 19 percent january decline in construction of singlefamily 
homes and apartments reported by the commerce department raised 
new concerns among some economists about the possibility of a 
recession this year 
however other analysts pointed to a second government report 
showing that industrial production rose for the fourth consecutive 
month in january the 02 percent rise in industrial output 
followed larger gains of 04 percent in both november and december 
economists are looking for continued strength in manufacturing 
bolstered by rising export sales to offset expected weakness in 
the consumer sector 
the january decline in housing construction followed an even 
larger 155 percent december plunge and pushed building activity 
down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 138 million units 
the slowest pace since a rate of 130 million units in december 
1982 just as the last recession was ending 
housing is being watched very closely in the aftermath of the 
record 508point drop in the stock market last october because it 
is often one of the first sectors to weaken at the onset of a new 
recession 
economists said the two consecutive monthly declines in housing 
construction did not guarantee a recession especially since other 
economic sectors have been showing strength but analysts said 
further weakness in this important industry would be troubling 
if housing continues to weaken it would obviously increase 
the chances of a recession said lawrence chimerine head of the 
wefa group formerly wharton econometrics the rise in exports 
would not be enough to offset a big drop in housing and consumer 
spending a lot will depend on what happens in the next few 
months 
the weakness suggests that people have been scared by the 
stock market crash and are unwilling to take on the commitment of a 
home mortgage said david wyss an economist with data resources 
inc of lexington mass 
other analysts said that unusually severe january weather had 
contributed to the decline in starts last month and they predicted 
better figures in coming months particularly in view of the fact 
that mortgage rates have been dropping in recent weeks 
fixedrate 30year mortgages have fallen to a nationwide 
average of 984 percent down almost a full percentage point since 
jan 1 and the first time they have been in singledigits since 
last april 
we expect housing starts will pick up in february and march 
interest rates are lower and consumer confidence and employment 
have both strengthened said warren lasko executive vice 
president of the mortgage bankers association 
the weakness last month came from a 29 percent decline in 
construction of singlefamily homes which fell to an annual rate 
of 101 million units 
this drop offset a 08 percent increase in construction of 
multifamily housing which edged up to an annual rate of 366000 
units that was still 35 percent below the level of activity in the 
apartment sector a year ago activity in the apartment sector 
reflects a slump that followed enactment of the new tax law which 
removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real 
estate 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of 
home builders said that a rate of singlefamily starts above 1 
million still reflected strength in that sector but he said the 
overall industry was being held back by the prolonged slump in 
apartment activity 
he said multifamily construction is likely to fall further 
especially in the south where vacancy rates are high 
in january construction starts fell 171 percent in the south 
to an annual rate of 469000 units starts were down an even larger 
218 percent in the midwest to an annual rate of 223000 units 
two other regions showed strength however starts rose 276 
percent in the northeast to an annual rate of 291000 units and 
were up 212 percent in the west to a rate of 394000 units 
building permits considered a good sign of future activity 
fell 82 percent in january to an annual rate of 125 million 
units the lowest level for permits since january 1985 permits had 
fallen 74 percent in december 
the federal reserve boards report on industrial production 
showed the january strength came from production of nondurable 
goods which rose 04 percent production of durable goods items 
expected to last three years showed no increase last month as a 
big drop in auto and steel production offset increases in the 
output of light trucks and defense equipment

sen albert gore jr dismissed his poor showing 
in new hampshire and sought support wednesday in southern states 
saying too much emphasis had been put on early presidential 
contests 
he also criticized fellow democratic candidates accusing them 
of being out of touch and saying i see all of the other 
candidates as peas in the same pod 
this is the kickoff of the main event in this election year 
gore said at a conference for supporters telecast from houston 
this is the time we kick our campaign into high gear 
he made his comment about peas in the same pod earlier in 
an interview on cbs this morning in that same interview he 
said his rivals picked up some harmful political baggage in the 
form of positions they adopted in iowa and new hampshire 
in houston gore said he had no regrets about skipping the new 
hampshire primary and iowa caucuses and turning his money and 
attention to the south where more than a dozen states have 
contests on march 8 known as super tuesday 
the tennessee senator who finished fifth in the new hampshire 
primary tuesday with about 7 percent of the vote had campaigned 
little there and in iowa where he also did poorly 
the importance of super tuesday is not simply in the fact that 
almost half the delegates will be selected on march 8 gore said 
the importance of super tuesday is also in the fact that there 
are people all over the united states who have been waiting to see 
more power given to democrats at the grassroots level in the 
selection of a democratic nominee 
the conference was telecast to an estimated 52 locations in more 
than 30 cities about 40 supporters attended at the site of the 
telecast in houston 
gore said three democratic rivals he later identified them as 
jesse jackson richard gephardt and michael dukakis have taken 
positions on foreign policy and defense policy that are completely 
out of touch with the mainstream voters in this country 
gephardt who finished second in new hampshire and won the iowa 
caucuses has flipflopped on issues in his campaign gore said 
it is now very widely known that dick gephardts positions 
adopted for the iowa caucuses are just completely at odds with what 
hes done in the last 12 years in the house and senate he said 
theres a very long list its not just one or two positions 
gore had other scheduled stops in beaumont texas shreveport 
la and dallas on wednesday as he continued his campaign in the 
south and other super tuesday states 
were going to win it because weve conserved our resources to 
aim right at the super tuesday states he said

floridas first milliondollar lottery 
winner has already changed his telephone number because people keep 
calling to suggest ways of sharing or investing his fortune 
thomas sawyers hands were still shaking after winning the grand 
prize saturday when a woman in the crowd handed him a pamphlet for 
a charity and walked away without saying a word 
that was just the beginning of the hassles of being a new 
millionaire sawyer said 
actually he isnt quite a millionaire his aftertax winnings 
of 800000 were transferred into his bank account tuesday 
sawyers win was the more astounding because he never bought a 
ticket something he says hell never do because hes opposed to 
all lotteries 
instead he found a ticket that had been discarded in front of 
his store and sent it in to the milliondollar drawing which 
included about 460000 other entries 
proceeds from the lottery are earmarked for education and on 
wednesday floridas assistant commissioner of education received a 
check for 462 million representing the first installment the 
game has generated sales of about 300 million 1 tickets in five 
weeks 
its a redletter day for us said lottery secretary rebecca 
paul were extremely proud and pleased 
the money will be used to pay for such items as student 
financial aid dropout prevention programs equipment library 
books and training programs for february and march 
lt gov bobby brantley who presented the check to laurey 
stryker assistant commissioner of education said he wanted to 
emphasize that the lottery wont generate enough money to take care 
of all education needs and that gov bob martinez wants the 
proceeds to be used for onetime expenses to enhance education 
rather than for operating costs 
since the drawing sawyer said his telephone hasnt stopped 
ringing 
ive got a few calls from charities he said but theyre 
not as big a hassle as the various investment companies 
everybody says they want to help 
sawyer said he had his telephone number changed monday to an 
unlisted number but that didnt stop aggressive fortuneseekers 
who somehow learned his new number 
at home his wife and daughters screen the calls several 
employees do the same at his st petersburg paint store 
there are undoubtedly a million charities worth giving to 
sawyer said i dont question that everyone cant support 
everything even the government cant do that and theyve got a 
lot more money than i do 
sawyer already has pledged 10 percent of the money to his church 
and does not know whether he will give any of the remaining money 
away 
sawyer said he will take advice from the accountant who has 
handled his business finances for the last several years there 
will be no special consultants or highpriced investment firms he 
said

the plo said wednesday it had shelved 
plans for a ship of return to take 130 deported palestinians to 
israel two days after the vessel was bombed in a cyprus harbor 
plo officials said a last attempt to charter another ship had 
failed 
we have now decided to temporarily postpone the date of 
sailing said sheik abdulhamid alsayeh president of the 
palestine national council the plo legislature he was the first 
person israel deported after capturing arab east jerusalem in the 
1967 middle east war 
he told a news conference the voyage would take place in the 
near future but organizers would not mention a date they sent 
home the hundreds of people including observers and journalists 
scheduled to make the trip who had been in athens for nine days 
those involved said it may have been the largest nonviolent 
protest ever attempted by the palestine liberation organization 
hanna nasser a member of the organizing committee and 
interpreter for sayeh called the effort a success because it has 
shown the world the amount of terrorism that is directed by israel 
it is ready to blow up a ship simply because it has 
palestinian people going on a peaceful mission said nasser who 
was president of bir zeit university in the israelioccupied west 
bank before he was deported 
the sol phryne a ferry obtained for the voyage was damaged 
monday by a mine attached below the waterline at limassol cyprus 
plo officials accused israel of planting the mine which ripped 
a sixfoot hole in the ferrys hull 
israeli officials did not deny it and transport minister chaim 
corfu said that if the plo gets another ship its fate will be 
the same 
prime minister yitzhak shamir called the voyage a declaration 
of war bassan abu sharif plo spokesman claimed earlier that 
israel made the search for a ship difficult by threatening owners 
and crew members the voyage initially had been scheduled to begin 
feb 9 at piraeus the port of athens 
the voyage was intended to focus attention on israels policy of 
deporting palestinians from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the un security council declared last month that such expulsions 
are illegal 
jordanian and palestinian figures say up to 3000 palestinians 
have been deported since 1967 
on sunday the day before the ship was mined three plo officers 
were killed in limassol by a bomb planted in their car 
thousands of palestinians and jordanians attended a funeral 
wednesday in amman jordan for two of the victims mohammad bassam 
altamimi and mohammad hassan bheis the body of the third man 
marwan kayyali was taken to lebanon for burial

a few leftovers from the new hampshire 
primary campaign tales of food and love laughs and life along the 
political trail 
first the food presidential candidates have such tight 
schedules they often dont get a chance to eat 
sen paul simon of illinois detoured through a burger king 
drivein for a hamburger on one swing former gov bruce babbitt of 
arizona dined on finger sandwiches at a head start center 
but vice president george bush ate three breakfasts within an 
hour one morning not because he was hungry but because the polls 
had him running behind sen bob dole of kansas 
bush had switched his campaign style to one of more informality 
sliding into booths with voters for pancakes at bickfords family 
restaurant coffee at dunkin donuts and anegg mcmuffin at 
mcdonalds 
the next morning on voting day in the new hampshire primary a 
woman at the polls told bush she had skipped breakfast to see him 
im not having breakfast today he said i had three of 
them yesterday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
now some love notes 
bushs son neil met a young woman from nashua named sharon 
while campaigning for his father in the new hampshire primary eight 
years ago george bush lost that one to ronald reagan but neil 
bush won sharon they were married and came back to campaign for 
bush this time 
after simon had telephoned soviet refusenik elena keiskuna in 
leningrad to offer his support and best wishes she sent him a 
kiss on that same day sunday valentines day simon campaigned 
in the streets of manchester one of his stops was a florists shop 
where he presented his wife jeanne with red roses she gave him a 
real kiss 
babbitt may not have won the hearts and minds of the voters in 
new hampshire finishing sixth among the seven democratic 
candidates but hes a winner to hattie his wife often at his 
side she would reassure him youre my candidate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it helps to be able to laugh a little especially when youre 
hurting a lot 
while babbitt came up a loser when the votes were counted he 
wins an award for best selfdepreciating humor 
example you know a guy came up to me in des moines and shook 
his head and said to me babbitt you were in it right up to the 
very beginning

do 
when alexander haig announced his candidacy for the republican 
presidential nomination in manchester he praised new hampshire 
voters for being intelligent and for not falling for campaign 
imagery 
then he got caught up in it himself flying to the far north 
country to remote but politically famous dixville notch where the 
few residents grab a lot of attention in the media every primary 
year by casting the nations first votes 
by the time those ballots went in the box this time though 
haig had given up his campaign 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
and its nice to get a little help from your friends especially 
if they are heavy hitters 
bush brought in some for his campaign he had ted williams the 
boston red sox baseball hall of fame slugger on his side he also 
had the gops mr conservative barry goldwater the former arizona 
senator and the partys 1964 presidential nominee in his corner 
and jazz artist lionel hampton performed at house parties his 
vibes turned out to be good ones for bush who found in new 
hampshire just the note he wanted victory over dole

australian craig logan picked a crisp cloudless 
day for his first trip to the top of the empire state building 
wednesday but he did it the hard way he ran 
logan led a field of 79 men and 27 women who thundered up the 
stairwell to the top of the 102story landmark for glory fitness 
and the firstplace prize of a macintosh computer in the 11th 
annual empire state building runup his winning time was 11 
minutes 29 seconds 
it wasnt too bad really logan a 26yearold pastry chef 
from melbourne said modestly still he admitted it gets a bit 
boring going around and around and around 
the top womens finisher was olympic hopeful janine aiello of 
san francisco whose time of 13 minutes 43 seconds was 28 seconds 
off her womens record in the event set in 1985 
ms aiello a native of suffern ny interrupted her training 
for the olympic marathon to compete for the fifth time in the 
event it feels great she said after her victory my mom was 
here my aunts from new york it was just so great to see their 
faces 
logan said he won the opportunity to compete in the empire state 
building runup by winning a similar event last august in a 
56story hotel in melbourne that one felt harder he said 
he attributed his victory in part to being the first man into 
the stairwell no small advantage considering the crunch of 
bodies that followed him

naked as the day she was poured a nude 
woman on display with 22 other sculptures in a tony art gallery is 
attracting more than passing glances 
you can tell shes real look at the dirt on the soles of her 
feet its a dead giveaway one spectator said tuesday as he 
viewed the kneeling polyvinylid sculpture titled the sphinx by 
californian john de andrea 
the eyecatching work is part of an exhibit showing through 
march 8 at the helander gallery in this posh island resort 
the 86000 sculpture with blue eyes ashen hair pulled into a 
loose bun and pearl earrings was chosen as the window piece 
because she is an exemplary of the exhibit and an excellent work of 
figure said gallery curator wendy cohen also because we knew 
the effect she would have 
the only drawback is that we have to clean the windows five 
times a day because of the hand prints and noses pressed to the 
glass said helander owner bruce helander 
it took five painstaking months for de andrea to cover the 
figure with layers of transluscent fleshtoned paint and add 
veins freckles and beauty marks ms cohen said

president reagan is planning to name william 
a brown a leading expert on soviet affairs as the new us 
ambassador to israel a senior us official said today 
brown 57 now the us envoy to thailand will replace thomas 
r pickering a career foreign service officer who has served in 
tel aviv since 1985 and is being considered for another post in the 
state department 
assuming he is confirmed by the senate brown will play an 
important role in the growing us drive to promote peace talks 
between israel and jordan 
his job would entail trying to persuade a reluctant prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to yield territory on the west bank in 
exchange for a settlement 
shamirs resistance to a concession opposed by the likud 
coalition could test the diplomatic skill of the 32year veteran of 
the foreign service 
brown served as deputy ambassador to tel aviv the united 
states does not recognize jerusalem as israels capital from 1979 
to 1981 he is known primarily as an expert in soviet and asian 
affairs and as a linguist 
brown a harvard graduate and exmarine speaks russian 
chinese french japanese mongolian and malay he was a leading 
contender for the ambssadors post in moscow probably the most 
important in the foreign service before jack matlock was selected 
by reagan in january 1987 
one of the touchy angles in us diplomacy in the middle east is 
the role to be played by the soviet union jordan insists on 
moscows taking an active part while shamir is opposed to its 
participation in consideration of an arabisraeli settlement 
shamirs two main reasons are that the soviets generally support 
arab positions and moscow does not have diplomatic relations with 
israel ties were broken by the soviets in 1967 when israel 
defeated egypt jordan and syria in the sixday war 
last year however the soviets sent a diplomatic delegation to 
israel and a small israeli group is likely to go to the soviet 
union this year

a coalition of members of congress announced 
wednesday that they plan to sue the census bureau in an effort to 
force the agency to delete illegal aliens from its count in 1990 
some 40 members of the house joined the federation for american 
immigration reform in announcing that the suit would be filed 
thursday in us district court in pittsburgh spokesmen said at a 
news conference here 
the group contends that including the estimated 2 million or 
more illegal aliens in the national head count which is used to 
distribute seats in the house of representatives will cause unfair 
shifts of seats from one state to another 
census officials say they are required to count everyone by the 
us constitution which does not mention citizenship but only 
instructs that the house apportionment be based on the whole 
number of persons residing in the various states that approach 
was upheld by a federal court in a similar suit brought by the 
same immigration reform group before the 1980 census 
nonetheless dan stein of the immigration reform federation 
contended that illegal aliens should not be allowed to be part of 
determining the political structure of the united states 
rep tom ridge rpa said the census bureau should actually 
count everyone but that it should develop a method to determine how 
many people are illegally in the country and them deduct that 
number from the figures used for reapportioning congress 
rep jan meyers rkan suggested including a question on the 
census form asking whether respondents are us citizerns

megahit moviemaker steven spielberg was 
snubbed again wednesday by the academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences as a nominee best director although his empire of the 
sun earned six nominations 
spielberg the top moneymaking director of all time but never a 
winner for best director was out of town and presumably has no 
reaction said chris kelly his spokeswoman at amblin productions 
spielberg was nominated for direction in jaws raiders of 
the lost ark and et the extraterrestrial 
five years ago et the extraterrestrial the 
biggestgrossing movie in history did not win either for best 
picture or for spielbergs direction 
then two years ago and after such smashes as jaws close 
encounters of the third kind et and the indiana jones 
adventures it seemed hollywoods establishment would embrace the 
color purple a drama fraught with social significance 
however spielberg was not nominated for his direction though 
the directors guild of america voted its 1985 bestdirected film 
prize to spielberg and the color purple 
this year spielberg was in distinguished company among the 
overlooked 
james l brooks was nominated for producing the bestpicture 
nominee broadcast news and for writing it but not as director 
the directors branch of the academy neglected spielberg and 
brooks to reward five foreigners britishers adrian lyne fatal 
attraction and john boorman hope and glory italian

all eyes turn toward texas this week as democratic 
and republican presidential candidates converge on dallas for the 
first major event of the super tuesday campaign the texas debates 
the 12 candidates who survived the new hampshire primary have 
set their sights on the 20 states holding primaries on super 
tuesday march 8 focusing much of their attention on texas which 
leads the states with 183 democratic and 111 republican delegates 
texas is the crown jewel in this because we are the largest 
said state democratic party chairman bob slagle 
the debates which will be aired nationally on the public 
broadcasting system from southern methodist university begin 
thursday at 9 pm est with the democratic candidates the gop 
hopefuls debate the following night 
sen albert gore jr a tennessee democrat who calls southern 
states key to a presidential win and vice president george bush a 
republican candidate who maintains a houston address say they 
welcome the chance to debate in dallas 
topics likely to take center stage in the debates include 
economic issues in the southwest including unemployment and the 
energy industry 
bush a former congressman from houston who still claims it as 
his home is all too familiar with texas issues such as energy 
immigration policy and the business climate said kevin moomaw his 
texas political director in austin 
certainly with a 40year association in this state and with 
george jr from midland he understands whats going on down 
here moomaw said 
presidential candidates with southern ties may have the edge in 
the debates which come only two days after the new hampshire 
primary in which bush won the republican race and massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis outdistanced the democratic field 
gore a democrat deemphasized the new hampshire primary and 
iowa caucuses in his strategy concentrating his efforts on the 
south 
with 20 states and about 40 percent of the delegates chosen on 
that day it made sense to focus his efforts down here said tom 
jurkovich texas coordinator for the gore campaign in austin 
being from the region gives him an understanding of the people 
and concerns that gives him a certain edge 
gore was dead last in iowa after pulling his campaign out of 
that state last year 
this is our chance to counter iowa and new hampshire and say 
those two states are too big for their britches and their britches 
are not all that big at that slagle said 
the debates are sponsored by the dallas morning news keratv 
and texas monthly magazine roger mudd a special correspondent on 
the macneillehrer news hour and former coanchor of nbc 
nightly news will moderate 
all the candidates are expected to take part in the debate 
besides those issues whats important is how these guys come 
across and it may be that many texans will now start focusing on 
the presidential race slagle said texans have said they want 
to be able to have a say early on who the next president is

pope john paul ii has written the seventh 
encyclical of his papacy a major document summarizing and updating 
the roman catholic churchs concerns for social and economic 
justice 
the encyclical a letter addressed to church leaders will be 
released by the vatican on friday 
the document is entitled in latin sollicitudo rei socialis 
meaning the social concern of the church 
john paul announced the document himself declaring in a speech 
in december that it was being written to coincide with the 20th 
anniversary of the social encyclical populorum progressio 
development of peoples published by pope paul vi in 1967 that 
document stressed the needs of third world countries for a better 
deal from the developed world 
john paul said the new encyclical would reveal the new themes 
and respond to the new problems of social development in the past 
two decades and that he hoped the document would spur concrete 
proposals for international cooperation 
the rome newspaper la repubblica said the document is expected 
to reflect the popes concerns for the excesses of both the 
freemarket capitalist and totalitarian systems and his emphasis on 
the importance of human values 
throughout his papacy john paul has stressed the human element 
in the productive process the primacy of people over things 
this was the theme of his other major social encyclical on 
human work issued in 1981 
during a visit to canada in 1984 he delivered an indictment of 
unfettered capitalism and urged governments to reorder their 
economic priorities so that human needs were put before mere 
financial gain 
john paul was following a tradition that has seen catholic 
social teaching evolve to respond to the problems spawned by modern 
industrial society 
the encyclical rerum novarum condition of the working 
classes issued by pope leo xiii in 1891 defended the right to hold 
private property but insisted that material goods had to meet the 
needs of all humanity 
paul vis 1967 encyclical took this further as it stressed the 
needs of the third world and its economic development 
the encyclical proposed higher taxes on the rich regulation of 
world trade expropriation of large estates if they impeded general 
prosperity and the establishment of a world fund in which some of 
the money spent on arms would be used to ease poverty in the world 
private property does not constitute for anyone an absolute 
and unconditioned right no one is justified in keeping for his 
exclusive use what he does not need when others lack 
necessities paul vi wrote 
john paul has used his encyclicals to criticize the materialism 
of communist and capitalist countries warn that the arms race 
threatens the destruction of mankind and to condemn atheism and 
marxism

this wealthy bedroom community could 
probably field a celebrity allstar team for any sporting event 
but its days in little league competition may be numbered because 
of a shortage of adult volunteers 
it seems to be a combination of parents being busy and a 
little lazy said little league president joseph arcudi who has 
been involved in the sport for 14 years 
weve only asking for a few hours each week for a 14week 
season ive never seen such a lack of interest 
westport a community 50 miles northeast of new york city is 
home to a number of celebrities including actors paul newman 
joanne woodward frank gorshin and sandy dennis and writers ae 
hotchner robert ludlum and frank deford as well as executives who 
commute to the city 
arcudi said he plans to hold a meeting on the leagues future in 
midmarch to try to attract volunteers he said he needs at least 
10 more people to fill jobs such as coaches and equipment managers 
for the towns program which serves more than 330 boys age 7 to 12 
if not enough people come forward there will be no little 
league arcudi said a reduced season is not any good because 
kids dont learn what they should in that amount of time 
steve keever director of little league baseball inc with 
headquarters in illiamsport pa said he has not heard of another 
community in the country whose little league program is in jeopardy 
there are about 25 million children ages 7 to 18 who 
participate in little league in 28 countries he said in 
connecticut there are 34900 little league players on 2500 teams 
keever called westports situation too bad because the 
youngsters are the ones to suffer 
if apathy is the reason its going to take a localized effort 
to make people realize the benefits of the program so it does not 
go down the drain keever said our program is founded upon 
volunteers without them were nothing 
little league is not dying said westport little league 
secretary linda abraham our enrollment is up and we are not 
bankrupt there are just not enough parent volunteers to run the 
organization

george bushs surprising showing in the new 
hampshire primary marks a volatility in voter decisionmaking that 
may continue to trouble pollsters as the 1988 campaign unfolds 
analysts said wednesday 
preelection polls released as late as tuesday morning generally 
missed the extent of the lastminute swing that gave bush his 
9point victory over kansas sen bob dole they said most surveys 
had indicated a dead heat 
its the timing and the volatility of this nothing is 
anchored said andrew kohut president of the gallup 
organization whose final new hampshire poll had put bush 8 points 
behind dole theres a lot of bouncing around 
the problem is an old one for pollsters their surveys are out 
of date as soon as they are completed and cannot account for voter 
turnout or for very late changes brought about by advertising or 
campaign organization 
for many years there has been a feeling that preprimary 
polling is hazardous to ones health in the early states in 
particular this year on the republican side thats how it was 
said laurily epstein pollster for nbc news people change their 
minds and you cant poll for that 
epstein and others noted that the polls had correctly tracked 
trends in the race if not anticipating the precise outcome all 
showed bush well ahead last month then slipping badly after dole 
and pat robertson beat him in the iowa caucuses feb 8 they had 
dole taking a narrow lead by friday then bush rebounding to a thin 
edge during the weekend and monday 
the tracking polls understated the size of his win but 
tracking polls are only an indication of expectations beforehand 
said warren mitofsky polling chief for cbs news the thing that 
polls can do best is show you direction it showed the direction 
the movement to bush the last few days 
the final cbs newsnew york times survey done sunday and 
monday had a 4point lead for bush 34 to 30 for dole the final 
result was within the surveys margin of sampling error of 6 
points the last abcwashington post poll with results from 
saturday through monday had it 32 to 30 for dole the boston globe 
had it 3130 for bush and the boston heraldwbz poll had it 3230 
for bush nbc news eschewed late polling 
the greatest gap was for gallup whose last poll done from 
friday to 4 pm sunday had dole with 35 percent and bush with 27 
kohut said the dichotomy between that poll and the bushdole result 
would prompt changes at gallup later polling if possible and 
greater sensitivity to the vagaries of candidates support 
in retrospect kohut said twothirds of bushs backers had told 
gallup they supported the vice president strongly while only half 
of doles supporters said they felt strongly about him the finding 
was an indication of bushs ability to turn out his vote and 
doles weakness in that area 
we knew bushs support was strong and doles was soft but we 
didnt put enough emphasis on that kohut said the lesson is 
that even if a frontrunners lead seems stable it remains 
vulnerable to lastminute changes if it is soft not pointing that 
out was a real failure on our part

senate gop leaders record bush replied i think i said it 
wasnt true but ill be glad to 
you all want me to talk about senator dole i want to talk

a japaneseowned auto carrier ran aground 
in the persian gulf on wednesday and although there were initial 
fears it had struck a mine divers determined it had only scraped 
its bottom 
iran meanwhile reacted to the announced cutback in us naval 
forces in the region by saying the move represented a defeat for 
american militaristic policy 
at a news conference assistant defense secretary richard 
armitage confirmed that the battleship iowa and two escort vessels 
had left the arabian sea in recent days and the helicopter carrier 
okinawa was about to depart from the gulf 
tehran radio monitored in london said the pullout showed the 
ineffectiveness of washingtons policies in the persian gulf 
and the disgraceful defeat of futile military moves carried out in 
support of the iraqi regime and reactionary arab countries and in 
the form of direct action against irans islamic revolution 
it said washington was searching for a way to withdraw without 
losing face for itself or its european allies a reference to the 
five countries that joined last years buildup of forces to protect 
commercial shipping from iranian mines and attacks 
the 4842ton motor vessel prosper world was heading out of the 
gulf after delivering a cargo of new cars when it ran aground 
initial reports from shipping sources in dubai quoted the 
captain of the liberianflag ship as reporting an explosion and oil 
leak lloyds shipping intelligence unit in london later said 
flatly that the prosper world had hit a mine 12 miles off the 
coast 
divers who inspected the ship informed its captain a south 
korean that he had just run aground and the whole bottom plate 
was wrinkled 
the ship owned by the masumoto shipping company of hyogo 
japan was believed in no danger and was heading for a drydock for 
further inspection and repairs the sources said 
no vessel is reported to have struck a mine in the persian gulf 
since the small ocean survey ship marissa i flying the panamanian 
flag was blown up off saudi arabia on sept 4 four crew members 
died 
since then senior officers of the united states and other 
western navies have declared the threat from mines sown by iran 
under control and have ordered a reduction in the number of 
minehunting vessels in the gulf 
armitage in his meeting with reporters disclosed that iran 
for the first time in recent memory had used one of its 
ussupplied f14 tomcats in a combat role shooting down an iraqi 
fighterbomber with an americanmade sidewinder missile previous 
f14 activity had been limited to reconnaissance he said 
the f14 was one of 10 remaining from the late shah mohammad 
reza pahlavis air force armitage gave no details but it 
apparently was involved in a dogfight on feb 8 when iran claimed 
it shot down three iraqi jets

with the biggest primary day in history three 
weeks away presidential campaigns are hoarding their cash and 
searching for more to pay for campaigning and television 
advertising time in the 20 super tuesday states 
sen paul simon said bluntly on wednesday that his presidential 
campaign cannot continue unless he draws more money by contrast 
wellheeled democrat michael dukakis has 4 million available for 
the most pivotal date of the 1988 primary season on march 8 
rep jack kemp straining for the republican nomination against 
betterfunded opponents said his campaign is in the black and 
counting on his thirdplace showing in new hampshire to help boost 
fund raising 
rep richard gephardt dmo who relied on this years federal 
matching funds to pay off sizable debts said wednesday that money 
is not a problem for him at this point 
were raising money at a good clip he said 
gephardt will need a good influx to remain competitive with 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts and sen albert gore jr 
dtenn in the south 
gore is not as flush as dukakis but has already has a big media 
jump on his opponents thanks to his strategy of concentrating on 
the south while his opponents vied on the battlefields of iowa and 
new hampshire 
last week gore launched a 1 millionplus tv campaign across the 
country 
we will outspend every other candidate toward super tuesday 
deputy press secretary paul risley said he declined to give an 
overall spending figure but said said the campaign has 22 
million in cash on hand and intends to spend a minimum of up to 3 
million on media alone toward super tuesday 
he said the current gore commercials featuring a biographical 
message are running in 14 south and border states and nationwide 
on cable news network and other cable stations 
dukakis who has concentrated considerable resources on the 
delegaterich super tuesday states of florida and texas has 4 
million in the bank deputy press secretary steven akey said 
wednesday he said the campaigns media buys had not been decided 
yet for super tuesday but that several fundraising events are 
scheduled and we have the resources to go the distance 
despite simons successful fundraising events in boston and in 
new york last week where 140000 was raised on the heels of his 
secondplace finish in iowa caucuses his campaign has debts of 
nearly 500000 said his press secretary terry michael 
i have to win either in south dakota or minnesota and we have 
to get additional campaign contributions those two things have to 
be there otherwise im going to have to withdraw simon said 
simon spokesman david carle later tried to paint the financial 
picture more positively 
he said simon hoped to raise 150000 at four events in chicago 
on wednesday night another event was planned thursday morning in 
st louis and a very very good response was coming from the 
48000 solicitation telegrams the campaign sent out to capitalize 
on the iowa results he said 
these two weeks are shaping up to be recordbreaking for the 
campaign in terms of money carle said estimating a total of up 
to 600000 might be raised 
babbitt who is to announce thursday whether he will continue 
his struggling presidential bid will end up about 150000 to 
200000 in debt if he drops out now said his press spokesman vada 
manager 
he said the campaign has about 30000 in cash on hand and that 
contributions slowed to a trickle after babbitts poor showing 
in the iowa caucuses last week 
after new hampshire its going to be worse he said 
on the republican side kemp ended the year seriously in debt 
but said his campaign has raised 300000 a week for the past five 
weeks and is now operating in the black thanks also to some 39 
million in federal matching funds he received since jan 1 
he said he intends to hit up his list of 110000 contributors in 
a fundraising push for super tuesday 
super tuesday could mean budgetwatching of a different type 
with the wellheeled vice president george bush sen bob dole and 
former tv evangelist pat robertson budgeting to keep spending low 
enough so they can save their big cash caches for states that come 
later 
bush has raised 204 million so far and has a series of 
fundraisers scheduled to reach the campaigns goal of 33 million 
said treasurer fred bush although the campaigns are limited by law 
to 27 million in overall primary campaign spending legal and 
accounting costs are exempted from the limit 
bush with 8 million in the bank is not worried about the cap 
however said spokeswoman ede holiday although he had spent more 
than 13 million by the end of the year only 79 million was 
applicable against the ceiling 
dole was wellsituated with 41 million in available cash and 
no outstanding debts said campaign spokesman tim archie 
pat robertson on the other hand had spent 124 million 
against the cap and dole spent 95 million against it by the end 
of 1987 
wellfunded campaigns must budget carefully so they can spend 
enough on the later states without going over the 27 million limit

soviet firefighters overseen by americans 
extinguished a fire wednesday in the us embassy the aging 
building the united states has been unable to abandon because of 
bugging devices that riddle a new structure 
about 150 embassy employees were evacuated and sent home for the 
day embassy spokesman richard gilbert said no one was injured 
us embassy officials said soviet firefighters were called to 
put out the fire in an unoccupied fifthfloor residential section 
after they decided embassy personnel couldnt extinguish it on 
their own 
the soviets responded promptly and were escorted at all times 
by american employees inside the building said gilbert who 
briefed reporters in the wet snow outside the mustardcolored 
embassys main door after the fire had been brought under control 
the 10story embassy building on busy tchaikovsky street near 
the center of moscow has been the source of controversy for more 
than a year 
last spring us officials said they had determined a new 
eightstory redbrick office building directly behind the old one 
could not be occupied immediately because of soviet listening 
devices apparently installed during construction 
the 191 million structure already was five years behind 
schedule at the time proposals have included razing part or all of 
the new structure or building a new office to house communications 
and secret operations 
us reps dan mica dfla and olympia snowe rmaine said in 
april that the old embassy building rented by the united states 
since the early 1950s was a firetrap and unsafe by accepted 
standards for general working conditions 
a renovation of the building has been under way since then 
gilbert said the fire might be construction related 
although its cause has not been determined it apparently started 
near a stairwell he said 
he said there was no damage to the main working areas of the 
embassy which begins on the sixth floor 
embassy second secretary michael hurley who was in his 
eighthfloor office at the time of the blaze said the smell of 
smoke increased before he evacuated 
somebody came through shouting excitedly theres a fire 
everybody out of the building hurley said 
he said he locked up his safe and left the building by a stairs 
that normally is closed the lower i went the more smoke i could 
see he said 
people were excited but there was an orderly exit hurley 
said 
embassy employees gathered in the rear courtyard to watch the 
blaze flames were leaping out of the building obviously it was 
a very hot fire and it was coming out of one window hurley said 
ambassador jack matlock was away from the embassy at the time 
but was alerted and returned to the site gilbert said 
last fall employees underwent fire drills conducted by state 
department experts hurley said 
viktor kononov moscows fire chief told the tass news agency 
that firefighters responded in four minutes to a call from one of 
the soviet guards who are stationed outside the embassy 
he said us guards wouldnt let us in for about five minutes 
more they were apparently waiting for clearance from senior 
officials 
firefighters found three rooms and a small hallway with traces 
of uncompleted repairs were on fire with flames enveloping tables 
chairs and construction garbage he said adding that it was 
extinguished in 20 minutes 
a more serious fire hit the top floors of the building in 1977 
and officials said afterward the damage was severe because 
ambassador malcolm toon refused to permit soviet firefighters to 
enter the topsecurity embassy communications center and some of 
its most sensitive work areas 
last spring a scandal erupted around charges that us marine 
guards had permitted soviet agents inside secret areas of the 
embassy 
the charges never were proven but marine sgt clayton lonetree 
was convicted in august of espionage for giving the soviets embassy 
floor plans and the identities of us intelligence agents after he 
had become sexually involved with a soviet woman

alain savary whose policies as education minister 
in 1984 caused street protests and a change in socialist 
governments died wednesday at age 69 
a socialist party statement said savary had been hospitalized 
for several weeks with a serious infection but did not give the 
cause of death 
savary proposed a bill in the national assembly in 1984 to carry 
out president francois mitterrands campaign promises to revamp the 
system of private education 
among its provisions the complex reform bill gave local 
authorities more control over management and finances of private 
schools it also gave teachers in those schools the option of 
retaining their status or choosing civil service status and linked 
state subsidies to the number of teachers who preferred the change 
nearly 16 percent of frances 12 million school children attend 
private schools of which 94 percent are roman catholic and heavily 
subsidized by the state 
the savary law inflamed passions for months opponents felt it 
threatened their right to choose how their children would be 
educated supporters wanted to hold mitterrand to his promise to 
create a unified secular public education service 
more than 1 million people joined daylong demonstrations across 
france on june 24 1984 
pierre mauroy then premier said the reforms had been totally 
misunderstood but the socialists withdrew the bill 
jean pierre chevenment replaced savary as education minister and 
mauroy gave way as premier to laurent fabius 
savary who was in the french resistance during world war ii 
had a reputation for being softspoken but stubborn 
he was a leader in the government formed just after liberation 
and a member of the national assembly and held ministerial 
positions under president charles de gaulle and in other 
governments 
born april 25 1918 in algeria then a french colony he was a 
strong advocate of decolonization of africa 
lionel jospin secretary of the socialist party said wednesday 
he represented socialism with his strong sense of morality his 
sense of justice and his commitment to the decolonization

us industrial production edged up 02 
percent in january despite big declines in auto production and 
steel the government said wednesday 
the federal reserve board said that the january increase was 
just half the 04 percent gain recorded in both november and 
december 
private analysts said this slower growth was consistent with 
their view that the economy will slow considerably in the early 
part of 1988 as businesses work off a backlog of unsold inventories 
built up during the final three months of 1987 
strength in domestic production helped push the overall economy 
as measured by the gross national product to a robust annual 
growth rate of 42 percent from october through december however 
nearly threefourths of that strength went into inventories rather 
than final sales 
analysts said this backlog will have to be worked off in coming 
months and will translate into an extremely sluggish economy in the 
first three months of this year 
lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group a private 
forecasting firm said that the smaller rise in industrial 
production was consistent with this view 
we are seeing a slowdown in domestic demand not only for 
cars but other consumer durables and this will hold down 
industrial production even though we are getting some offsetting 
strength from stronger export sales he said 
some economists are predicting gnp growth could be an actual 
negative number from january though march but most expect growth 
will resume in the spring keeping the country out of a recession 
we are seeing that while the economy is slowing down things 
are not stopping we think we will have sluggish growth in the 
first half of the year but no recession said david wyss senior 
financial economist at data resources inc of lexington mass 
the january increase in industrial production the fourth in a 
row left output 6 percent above where it was a year ago providing 
further evidence of the rebound manufacturers are enjoying as the 
weaker dollar boosts us exports to record levels 
the reagan administration is counting on the export strength to 
keep the country out of a recession this year 
output in the manufacturing sector rose 02 percent in january 
following a much larger 05 percent december advance 
the strength came from industries producing nondurable goods 
where production rose by 04 percent 
output of durable goods items expected to last at least three 
years showed no change at all in january 
production of cars fell by 74 percent in january to an annual 
rate of 65 million units the impact of this fall was offset in 
part however by an increase in production of light trucks and 
minivans which have now captured about onethird of the us 
consumer market 
also contributing to the weakness last month was a decline in 
iron and steel production which fell back following a sharp rise 
in december 
the mining industry suffered a 06 percent drop in january the 
second consecutive monthly downturn this sector which includes

a federal appeals court tuesday revived a 
lawsuit challenging the expansion of hunting on federal wildlife 
preserves when it ruled the humane society had legal standing to 
bring the case 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals here 
overturned a district judges finding that the humane society of 
the united states lacked the requisite legal standing to sue the 
interior department to stop hunting on nine federal wildlife 
preserves 
the gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting on 
wildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpses 
and environmental degradation in addition to depleting the supply 
of animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view the court 
said in an opinion written by judge patricia wald chief judge 
these are classic aesthetic interests which have always 
enjoyed protection under standing analysis wald wrote 
david j hayes a washington attorney who represented the humane 
society called the decision significant because it confirms that 
environmental groups like the humane society have the right to 
bring actions based on their members concerns about harms to their 
aesthetic interests 
an appellate decision upholding the dismissal of the lawsuit by 
us district judge thomas a flannery would have made it 
difficult for any wildlife group to bring suit for the protection 
of wildlife hayes said 
while ruling the society had a legal right to sue the court 
upheld the interior departments decision to allow waterfowl 
hunting on chincoteague island va 
the appeals court sent the case back to flannery to rule on the 
merits of the humane societys claims that the interior department 
had not properly evaluated the wildlife populations of other 
preserves before allowing hunting 
james goodrich executive vice president of the wildlife 
legislative fund of america inc a hunters group said he was 
disappointed by the courts decision but he predicted that hunting 
would be upheld at the other preserves 
on a single refuge the appeals court said that everything was 
proper in permitting hunting assumedly that would apply to all 
other refuges goodrich said

a note purportedly written by the 
kidnappers of two un relief workers said wednesday the captives 
were linked to an intelligence agency and would be freed only if 
proven innocent of espionage 
the swedish foreign minister disputed the allegations in the 
letter 
the note handwritten in arabic and delivered to a western news 
agency in beirut said hostages jan stening of sweden and william 
jorgensen of norway would be released only after they are proven 
innocent from the charges against them 
we announce to everybody that swede stening and norwegian 
jorgensen are involved with the secret service of a foreign country 
and this is becoming clear through investigation of them it said 
the two employees of the united nations relief and works agency 
which cares for palestine refugees were abducted by gunmen on feb 
5 near the south lebanese port city of sidon 
the relief agency blamed the abduction on palestinians acting 
individually without political motivations or links to any 
organization palestinian leaders have denounced the kidnappings 
the note which did not identify the kidnappers or give a date 
carried what were said to be the thumbprints and signatures of 
stening and jorgensen 
a similiar note said on saturday the kidnappers were 
interrogating them but made no specific accusations against them 
we remind everybody we are not aiming at causing harm to our 
steadfast people we appreciate the services of the un agency and 
call on them to be patient until the time comes for us to reveal 
all the information the note said 
we tell everyone who claims he is able to release them within 
a specific time or that the whereabouts of the hostages is known 
that their release will only take place when they are proved 
innocent of the charges against them the statement said 
swedish foreign minister sten andersson said the information in 
the letter is incorrect and false 
one reason for this is that stening with an impeccable 
service record in both sweden and unwra not could have lent 
himself to anything like that he said secondly i think the 
kidnappers need a motive that can be accepted by those who put 
pressure on them to release the hostages thats why they make this 
up this is a product of fantasy

the oregon supreme court ruled wednesday that 
a motorist arrested on a drunken driving charge must be given a 
chance to call a lawyer before deciding whether to take a breath 
test 
an arrested driver has a right under the oregon constitution to 
a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice before deciding 
whether to submit to a breath test the court said in a unanimous 
decision 
the court noting that evidence of bloodalcohol content 
dissipates with time said police arent required to wait for a 
long period of time before administering the test 
but the opinion didnt hand down any ironclad rules on what 
will amount to a reasonable time to allow motorists to contact 
attorneys 
a footnote to the opinion said however a period of 15 
minutes after the request to take the test has been made will 
doubtless suffice in most cases 
the decision was the supreme courts third in seven years on the 
issue of whether suspected drunken drivers have a right to legal 
advice before making a decision on a breath test 
refusing to take a breath test carries an automatic 120day 
drivers license suspension under state law 
in 1980 the supreme court said in a 43 ruling that arrested 
drivers were entitled to consult atorneys before deciding on breath 
tests 
a divided court in 1981 overruled that decision saying denial 
of access to legal counsel didnt require supression of breath test 
evidence 
the court wednesday overturned that decision basing its ruling 
on a provision in the state constitution giving anyone accused of a 
crime a right to obtain legal counsel 
the evanescent nature of the evidence the police seek from 
breath tests may justify substantially limiting the time in which 
the person may exercise his or her right but it does not 
justify doing away with it the court said in an opinion by 
justice michael gillette 
as a result defendant ronald spencers breath test findings 
cant be used as evidence against him spencer was arrested by a 
lane county sheriffs deputy on may 4 1985 and taken to the 
county jail his request to consult a lawyer before deciding on a 
breath test was refused 
his case was returned to the district court for trial

abbas ali hamadi told an 
acquaintance we have kidnapped a west german after a foreign 
businessman was abducted in beirut last year according to 
testimony wednesday in hamadis trial 
hamadi is charged with the january 1987 kidnapping of rudolf 
cordes and another west german in beirut 
the abductions were allegedly carried out to pressure bonn to 
free abbas hamadis brother mohammed ali hamadi who is being held 
in connection with the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner in which an 
american sailor died 
federal investigator klaus pruefer testified that an 
acquaintance of abbas hamadi hamsa kassim told police the 
defendant informed him that cordes had been kidnapped 
according to a police statement kassim quoted abbas hamadi as 
saying by telephone from beirut we have kidnapped a west 
german 
excerpts of kassims statement to police were read on wednesday 
in one excerpt kassim said hamadi told him that mohammed hamadi 
was arrested because he was one of the kidnappers of the american 
twa jetliner 
kassim told police that abbas hamadi made that statement jan 
14 1987 one day after his 23yearold brother was arrested at 
frankfurt airport carrying explosives 
the following week cordes and another west german alfred 
schmidt were kidnapped in beirut 
last week schmidt testified that abbas hamadi was not among the 
gunmen who kidnapped him from his beirut hotel jan 20 he said 
abbas hamadi was older and taller than the men who abducted him 
schmidt was released in september in what his kidnappers said 
was a goodwill gesture cordes is still being held 
last year west germany rejected a us request for the 
extradition of mohammed hamadi in the twa hijacking west german 
authorities last week charged him with murder and air piracy the 
same charges he would have faced in the united states a trial date 
has not been set 
a third west german citizen ralph rudolf schray was kidnapped 
in beirut three weeks ago in an apparent attempt to increase 
pressure on west germany to release the hamadi brothers 
no one has claimed responsibility for that kidnapping

bruce babbitt says he has appropriated 
hamlets dilemma to be or not to be 
the former arizona governor was talking wednesday about the 
possibility of ending his twoyear longshot presidential bid he 
said he would give his answer on thursday but fellow democratic 
candidate jesse jackson was already angling for his support if he 
should drop out 
babbitt aides said privately that he was unlikely to endorse 
anyone at least for now 
babbitt finished sixth of the seven major candidates in the 
democratic new hampshire primary edging gary hart by less than a 
thousand votes 
at a news conference before flying to washington babbitt told 
reporters i wont waste your time playing hamlet for more than 
24 hours but im sure going to do it for 24 hours he said he 
would make up his mind after speaking with advisers and his family 
in the closing days of the new hampshire campaign babbitt had 
appealed directly to voters to keep his campaign alive 
he talked wednesday of the possibility of staying in the race to 
try to force debate among the democratic contenders to make them 
face up to issues such as the federal budget deficit 
there will be a lot more debates he said and all you 
need to get into those debates and keep people honest and talk 
about the future is the price of a plane ticket even bruce babbitt 
can raise the price of a plane ticket 
in an interview with cbstv wednesday babbitt said there are 
some mornings you know i wake up in a motel six in some small 
town that i dont even know the name of im on the phone that 
night to my kids obviously they miss me ive been away too long 
those are the down moments then youre on the phone begging for 
money to meet the payroll and you say why did i ever get into 
this 
despite these regrets babbitt retained the optimism that has 
driven his candidacy for two years 
there are worse things than losing he said the worst 
thing of all would be to lose having had nothing to say not having 
made a difference 
babbitt said gary hart has urged him to stay in the race and 
that jackson has asked for his support if he quits 
he and jackson share a lot of experience from the 1960s 
babbitt said including the civil rights movement but he said he 
told jackson his request was premature 
jesse its awfully early babbitt quoted himself as saying 
im not ready to make any decision 
jackson who finished fourth in new hampshire said wednesday 
i hope i gain his support 
a babbitt endorsement would obviously broaden the base of my 
campaign he said 
babbitts new hampshire showing was worse than his finish in the 
iowa caucuses where he was fifth

boundary not only stand for friendship and peace but also signify 
an important bond

winning the new hampshire primary gave little 
more than bragging rights to vice president george bush and 
democrat michael dukakis as each came away with just a handful of 
national convention delegates 
bush who picked up 38 percent of the republican vote in the 
primary gained 11 of new hampshires 23 delegates to the gop 
national convention in all bush now has 61 delegates 
dukakis who got 36 percent of the democratic vote in the 
tuesday primary won nine of the states 18 pledged delegates to 
the national convention the massachusetts governor has 445 
delegates 
the lift from the early primaries and caucuses is more 
psychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1139 
delegates needed to win the republican presidential nomination or 
the 2082 delegates for the democratic nomination 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas gained seven 
delegates in new hampshire tuesday to bring his national total to 
42 while rep jack kemp of new york won three delegates to raise 
his total to 35 
rep richard gephardt of missouri the winner of last weeks 
iowa democratic caucuses gained six national convention delegates 
for his secondplace showing in new hampshire and sen paul simon 
of illinois followed with three delegates in the popular vote in 
new hampshire gephardt won 20 percent while simon had 17 percent 
gephardt now has 39 delegates while simon has 33 
under democratic party rules the national convention delegates 
were awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15 
percent of the vote in effect that disqualified jesse jackson 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee former arizona gov bruce 
babbitt and former colorado sen gary hart from receiving any 
delegates from new hampshire 
jackson won 8 percent of the vote gore 7 percent babbitt 5 
percent and hart 4 percent 
new hampshire republicans have a similar rule but the threshold 
is 10 percent that meant former delaware gov pete du pont who 
had 10 percent picked up two delegates but former television 
evangelist pat robertson who was within 1100 votes of du pont 
received no delegates because he had just 95 percent of the vote 
robertson already had eight delegates while du pont had none 
before tuesdays primary 
among the democrats gore already had 1055 delegates jackson 
had 98 and babbitt had four 
the delegate totals for the republicans include results from 
michigan kansas pennsylvania new hampshire and guam although 
iowa and hawaii both have held gop caucuses precise delegate 
figures cannot be calculated until later because of the way the 
selection process is structured 
the democratic totals include results from iowa and new 
hampshire as well as an associated press survey of democratic 
governors and democratic national committee members who will serve 
automatically as delegates to their partys convention some of the 
democratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention

are randy jeff chapman told a reporter for the miami news 
chapman 31 ran away from home when he was 17 and lives on the

another brother and sister who have already been tested and found 
incompatible

efforts to locate his brother in miami a friend of the younger 
chapman called the newspaper and told them chapmans whereabouts 
a reporter found chapman at the downtown dade county public 
library tuesday 
im not even going to consider it he said of the marrow 
donation request if i sound cruel well thats the way i feel 
im not a very forgiving person 
he said testing to see if his marrow is compatible with his 
brothers might interfere with a drug experiment in which he is 
going to participate starting monday at the university of miami 
thats how i make my living he said 
contacted at his hospital room steve chapman said his brothers 
decision disappointed him 
he must have turned into a hard person he said i guess

jerry foster of nbc affiliate kpnx in phoenix said he found a 
canister of the drug tuesday while filming near the salt river 
earlier in the day

mesquite jr high which is sponsoring a just say no to drugs 
program this week they turned it over to gilbert police 
the gilbert police officer wanted me to explain and i did 
foster said he called the sheriffs department and they backed 
me up 
sgt jay ellison said foster reported finding a small canister 
of marijuana a 32caliber pistol and some other items when he 
landed to change film near the river 
foster said he placed the canister in the jacket so it wouldnt 
spill 
gilbert police sgt steven olsen said the marijuana would be

new hampshires primary results produced a new 
flurry of speculation on wednesday that the democratic presidential 
campaign might end without a clear winner leading to a deadlocked 
nominating convention next summer 
but democratic party chairman paul kirk predicted were going 
to have a firstballot winner among the current contenders 
it was new york mayor ed koch who responded to the new hampshire 
returns by saying that delegates to the democratic convention would 
draft either new york gov mario cuomo or new jersey sen bill 
bradley 
i believe there will be a draft he said the strategy 
which was not a strategy to begin with but which is working 
marvelously is not to come in but to be drafteed at the 
convention 
bradley has consistently said he is not interested in entering 
the 1988 presidential race while cuomo has said he is not a 
candidate but has not flatly ruled out a late entry 
the governor on wednesday had kind words for virtually all the 
seven democratic contenders but told reoporters it was still too 
early for him to bestow his endorsement on any of them 
theres a long way to go he said 
cuomos support has been sought avidly by several of the 
democratic hopefuls in advance of the april 19 new york primary 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis scored a decisive triumph in 
the new hampshire primary with missouri rep richard gephardt a 
distant second and illinois sen paul simon just behind him in 
third place the outcome which had been expected left the field 
without a clear frontrunner and with a crowded roster of 
candidates heading into the delegaterich primaries and caucuses 
ahead 
but kirk speaking with reporters in washington said the 
players who are on the field thats where the games going to be 
won 
kirk said he had no doubt the field of candidates would begin to 
shrink as the primary season runs its course 
i dont believe for a minute that youll have six candidates 
running neck and neck right down to the convention as we move down 
to the final innings youll see signs of a final person 
emerging he said 
walter f mondales 1984 campaign manager political consultant 
robert g beckel said he thought it appeared less and less likely 
that any of the seven democratic candidates would arrive at the 
nominating convention with enough delegates to claim a victory on 
the first ballot 
i believe there will be brokering he said meaning that the 
frontrunning candidates at convention time would need alliances 
with their rivals for enough delegate support to win 
but he said that didnt mean a draft candidate emerging 
if theyre going to negotiate with anybody theyll negotiate 
with each other he said of the current contenders

motorcycle and moped riders in nebraska 
will be required to wear helmets starting next year under a 
controversial bill passed in the legislature wednesday 
the bill which passed on a 2520 vote takes effect jan 1 
1989 sen dan lynch the measures sponsor said gov kay orr 
would sign the legislation which includes a penalty of 50 for 
failure to wear a helmet 
during the floor debate about 70 spectators in the gallery 
many wearing motorcyle jackets and club colors applauded when 
sen ernie chambers characterized the bill as one that shouldve 
been left in the graveyard of bad bills 
the visitors appeared stunned and quiet after the vote 
the bill was passed after lynch withdrew a 14page amendment 
that would have required safety education for motorcycle riders 
lynch said 45 states have motorcycle laws including 19 that 
require helmets for everyone he said rhode island requires a 
helmet for passengers and 20 other states have socalled limited 
requirement laws usually having to do with the age of the 
motorcyclist 
gov kay orr has confirmed that she will sign the measure into 
law

a federal jury began deliberating racketeering 
charges wednesday against six men and two women accused of 
belonging to the westies a gang of thugs that allegedly terrorized 
manhattans hells kitchen neighborhood for 20 years 
the case which has featured graphic accounts of killings and 
dismemberments went to the jury after nearly four months of 
testimony and more than a week of closing arguments 
the panel worked for about 4 hours before breaking off 
deliberations for the night 
a 14count racketeering indictment charged the eight defendants 
were members of a criminal enterprise that seized control of the 
west side neighborhood and held sway there for nearly two decades 
through a series of killings and other violent crimes 
prosecutors also contended the westies trafficked in drugs 
counterfeit money and stolen goods engaged in loansharking and 
extortion and killed people who got in their way 
prosecutors mary lee warren and david brodsky said the westies 
had committed a series of killings that included dismembering the 
victims bodies in order to enhance their reputation and eliminate 
competitors 
the indictment listed the names of 10 alleged coconspirators 
who had been killed before the charges were brought in march 
the defense argued most of the evidence is based on the 
uncorroborated testimony of informers who were themselves killers 
thieves and drug dealers 
the main prosecution witness francis mickey featherstone 
said he had been the righthand man of reputed westies boss 
james coonan 
featherstone who has admitted committing three homicides 
himself testified he helped coonan conduct a loansharking business 
and was present at a 1978 meeting when the westies agreed to work 
with the gambino organized crime family 
he also linked coonan to the killing and dismemberment of a 
recalcitrant loanshark customer 
on crossexamination by coonans attorney gerald shargel 
featherstone acknowleged being in and out of mental hospitals in 
the 1970s lying under oath in the past and suffering psychotic 
episodes 
shargel and other defense lawyers also denied even the existence 
of an organization called the westies 
even government witnesses conceded the name westies was created 
by the police and news media to describe a group of mainly 
irishamerican hoodlums on manhattans west side 
in addition to coonan and his wife edna 44 both of hazlet 
nj the defendants are james jimmy mack mcelroy 42 william 
indian bokun 30 john halo 36 richard muggsy ritter 50 
thomas collins 53 and his wife florence 52 all of manhattan 
all face a maximum penalty of 20 years each if convicted of 
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy the most serious charges

nearly 57 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to the 
soviet union under the departments export enhancement program or 
eep for delivery in the fiscal year that began last oct 1 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said an additional 12 million tons 
of wheat are still available to the soviet union under current eep 
authorization 
under eep private exporters are given surplus commodities owned 
by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
sims said the subsidies or bonuses averaged 2748 per ton on 
the latest sales or about 75 cents per bushel the subsidies for 
the soviet union have been available only for wheat 
the sales also are part of the grain the soviet union is 
committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a longterm 
agreement which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 
million tons of us grain the pact expires sept 30 
according to the agreement the annual purchases include a 
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the soviets have 
the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat corn or 
soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain 
up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans or 394 bushels of corn 
in addition 167 million tons of us corn 800000 tons of 
soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by 
the soviets for delivery this year

leaders of white supremacist groups 
gathered in 1983 to discuss poisoning the water supplies of new 
york and washington dc and establishing an aryan nation in the 
place of the present us government federal prosecutors charged 
wednesday 
assistant us attorney steve snyder outlined the meeting in his 
opening statement to jurors hearing the trial of 14 men all linked 
with supremacist groups charged with conspiring to overthrow the 
government or kill federal officials 
defense attorneys contended that the issue in the trial was 
freedom of speech one of the defendants presenting his own 
opening statement told the jury youre about to get a great 
civics lesson 
a jury of 12 whites was selected for the trial tuesday because 
the trial is expected to last about three months judge morris s 
arnold seated six alternate jurors rather than the usual two 
according to snyder james ellison who is in prison discussed 
a poisoning scheme in 1983 at an aryan nations convocation in 
hayden lake idaho with richard g butler and robert miles 
butler 69 of hayden lake and miles 63 of cohoctah mich 
are among 10 defendants charged with seditious conspiracy which is 
conspiring to overthrow the government by force 
butler is the leader of the church of jesus christ christian 
aryan nations while miles is a former ku klux klan official 
convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school buses in pontiac 
mich 
ellison whose name is on the governments list of witnesses is 
the former leader of an arkansasbased militaristic supremacist 
group named the covenant the sword and the arm of the lord 
officials raised the groups compound in 1985 and seized weapons 
and a 39gallon drum of sodium cyanide 
at the time of the 1983 meeting ellison had more than 200 
pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession snyder said 
at that same conclave several supremacist leaders discussed the 
idea of abolishing the us government and setting up an aryan 
state snyder said 
louis ray beam jr 41 of houston a former texas klan leader 
and another of the defendants told the 1983 conference that the 
time had come for war snyder said 
snyder said beam told his audience that the antigod 
slithering homosexual dwelt in washington dc and warned if 
you dont help me kill them youre going to have to beg for 
your childs life and the answer will be no 
miles made a speech urging the use of robberies to finance 
supremacist activities snyder said and six holdups during the 
next 18 months netted supremacists more than 4 million 
ellison sent a paper around to be signed and when it came 
back signed by the leaders ellision said all of us today 
entered into a conspiracy against the government of the united 
states snyder said 
the prosecutor said no one disagreed with ellisons statement 
and the meeting ended with the nazi stiffarm hail victory 
salute 
butlers attorney everett d hofmeister g butler told the 
jury that freedom of speech was at stake in the trial and quoted 
the late us supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes as saying 
freedom of speech includes freedom for the thought we hate 
the whole nation is watching you hofmeister said what 
are the limits of freedom of speech even the speech we hate it is 
an aweesome responsibility that you have 
beam in his 90minute statement said that if the government 
will admit that the constitution is dead and there is no freedom of 
speech im guilty but if our constitution still exists im not 
guilty 
beam said he was under the impression i could say whatever i 
wanted to say in this country in fact at one time i fought for 
that right thats why im here some of my views are unpopular 
he also contended snyders account was a good story but 
thats all it is and he knew nothing about any such conspiracy 
snyder said the supremacists viewed whites as the people of god 
jews as the spawn of satan and blacks as subhuman the 
government was called zog for zionist occupation government 
two defendants william wade and his son ivan ray wade both of 
smithville enlisted the aid of ellisons group to murder a federal 
judge and an fbi agent who had been involved in the prosecution of 
people who harbored tax protestor gordon kahl snyder said in 
1983 kahl wanted in the killings of two federal marshals in north 
dakota was killed in a shootout near smithville at a home on land 
owned by william wade 
the wades wanted the csa to take action against judge h 
franklin waters the chief judge of the western district of 
arkansas and fbi agent jack knox to show the people that 
patriots cant be pushed around snyder said 
a group headed out of the csa compound on dec 26 1983 to 
carry out the killings but backed out after a van in which four of 
them were riding went out of control on a snowy road and collided 
with a pickup truck snyder said

union leaders uncertain which 
presidential candidate their members like but unwilling to accept 
sen albert gore jr are hoping to prevent the tennessean from 
upstaging the other democrats in the super tuesday round of 
primaries in three weeks 
although gore carries an 88 percent proaflcio lifetime voting 
record unusually high for a southern democrat and ahead of rep 
richard a gephardts 83 percent prolabor record some union 
political directors say they are having trouble slating members as 
gore delegates to the democratic national convention 
gore has just 85 union members running as delegates to the 
convention next july in atlanta from the eight states whose filing 
deadlines have passed compared with 255 for sen paul simon of 
illinois according to information provided by six presidential 
campaigns to the aflcio 
labor delegate totals for the the other five democratic 
candidates from all eight states were incomplete but the figures 
that were available indicated that gephardt and massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis were slating trade unionists in about equal numbers 
with simon except in the south where jesse jackson appeared 
strongest 
more laborites want to be gore delegates but his campaign is 
the only one that is actively shunning their support according to 
some union political directors 
hes not going after labor at all complained rachelle 
horowitz political director for the american federation of 
teachers the people he has running his campaign are 1976 jimmy 
carter types theyre not slating labor people 
ms horowitz who openly favors dukakis and is one of 42 
automatic labor delegates to the convention as members of the 
democratic national committee is counting on jackson to win 
between four and six of the 20 primaries and caucuses on march 8 to 
thwart gores southern strategy 
labor leaders here are counting on jacksons strong showing in 
the south to keep gore out of first or third place in the 
postsuper tuesday delegate counts and throw the race into the 
industrial state contests in illinois michigan new york 
pennsylvania and ohio where unions are strongest 
as a trade unionist of course id rather see it decided in 
the industrial states said robert a georgine president of the 
federations 4million member building and construction trades 
department 
aflcio president lane kirkland said wednesday he can still call 
the 91 presidents of the federations member unions together to 
make a preconvention endorsement if it appears any one candidate 
is beginning to garner overwhelming support among union members 
the essential criteria is the same at least a twothirds 
consensus he said but im not going to force it and im not 
going to invent it either 
while acknowledging their personal favorites most union 
presidents on the federations 36member policymaking executive 
council said none of the candidates has yet to muster that kind of 
support among their members 
william wynn president of the united food and commercial 
workers union the aflcios third largest with 1 million members 
doubts there will be an endorsement 
we cant change the fact that no individual has emerged he 
said our iowa locals got together and endorsed dukakis but it 
wasnt a very strong endorsement i would bet that jesse jackson 
got a lot of ufcw votes in iowa 
the aflcios early endorsement of walter mondale in 1984 helped 
save his campaign after he lost the new hampshire primary that year 
to gary hart of colorado but it also enabled mondales opponents 
to tag labor as a special interest candidate and created a 
backlash among many union members 
exit polls showed only about half the voters from union 
households pulled the lever for mondale in the general election 
far short of the twothirds majority support that the aflcio 
claimed that its endorsement represented union leaders here are 
intent on avoiding a repeat of that 
were damned if we do and damned if we dont said richard 
kilroy president of the transporation communications union and 
head of a coalition of 15 rail unions we may well go into a 
brokered convention and thats not a bad thing as far as were 
concerned obviously the best thing to do is not force a 
consensus

president reagans hit list for congressional 
porkbarrel spending will be released next week but not as the 
cutback legislation he promised in his state of the union address 
congressional sources said wednesday 
instead reagans list of cuts will be made in a symbolic 
statement of what he would do if granted his longstanding wish for 
authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills the 
cuts would have no legal effect unless congress takes up the cause 
barbara clay of the presidents office of management and budget 
said she was not certain a decision had been made 
but republiocan sources on capitol hill said omb director james 
c miller iii told them this week the list would not be in the form 
of rescission bills 
its going to be a package of suggestions from the 
president said one gop leadership aide speaking on condition of 
anonymity the new strategy could help avoid electionyear clashes 
with republican lawmakers who won spending projects last year the 
aide said 
a highranking omb official said the form of the request was not 
important its how much noise you make the official who 
demanded annoymity said in either case he doubted congress would 
go along 
the change in tactics appeared to be a retreat from the 
presidents nationally televised address last month the speech 
included a pitch for the lineitem veto which would allow him to 
reach into congress mammoth spending legislation and cut out items 
he considered wasteful 
reagan cited cranberry blueberry and crawfish research along 
with other items that he would cut if given the chance 
in 30 days i will send back to you those items as 
rescissions which if i had the authority to line them out i would 
do so the president told the democraticcontrolled congress 
the omb has been drafting the list which could total 4 
billion most of the targeted items were contained in the 600 
billion catchall spending bill approved at the end of last years 
session 
by proposing rescissions reagan could freeze spending on those 
items for 45 days and give procedural advantages to those in 
congress supporting his effort after the 45day period the 
spending would be restored unless the rescission were approved 
any lawmaker is allowed to propose rescission legislation but 
without the presidents impetus the path to passage is more 
difficult

richard gephardt focused on south 
dakota wednesday in an urgent search for a primary victory even as 
he contended second place in new hampshire was good enough to put 
him in a twoman democratic presidential race with michael dukakis 
i dont think there really is a true frontrunner today 
gephardt said its a tough race now i think in the rest of the 
country between dukakis and gephardt i think thats really 
what this race is going to boil down to 
gephardt spoke as he left manchester nh for rapid city and 
sioux falls sd to trumpet an endorsement by democratic sen tom 
daschle in a state where next tuesdays primary does not guarantee 
delegates 
gephardts claim to a twoman nomination battle overlooked two 
other democratic candidates who have staked much of their hopes and 
spent much of their time in the looming delegate battleground of 
the south jesse jackson and albert gore jr 
it also ignored illinois sen paul simon whose campaign limped 
into neighboring minnesota after backtoback narrow losses to 
gephardt in new hampshire and iowa 
gephardts leading rivals were campaigning in the south for much 
of what is to be a threeweek campaign there his focus instead was 
on a far less significant state on the primary calender where the 
democratic primary tuesday is a beauty contest in which voters 
state a preference that does not commit convention delegates 
gephardt was scheduled to visit south dakota during six of the 
next seven days he was gambling on a victory that would attract 
attention and make him look like a winner heading toward march 8 
when nearly onethird of the democratic delegates are at stake 
i think i can do well here gephardt said in an interview 
in order to do that i have to get my message across and see 
people 
this is just the way we think the time can be best spent to 
get the delegates to get the results we need he said 
he was also contesting wyomings caucuses where 13 delegates 
are at stake on march 5 
were doing a lot of south dakota and wyoming shuttling 
said ali webb gephardts press secretary 
she called them gateway states to super tuesday and said they 
are very important to us 
gephardt strategists said they decided not to contest three 
other states holding contests during the next three weeks vermont 
aod maine where dukakis figures to be strong and minnesota where 
dukakis and simon are campaigning 
the congressman attended a rally with daschle in sioux falls and 
toured a financially troubled electronics assembly plant in rapid 
city where he attacked unfair trade practices by japan 
gephardt has purchased 40000 worth of television commercials 
in south dakota a significant amount in the state of just 700000 
people gore and dukakis are already on the air here 
gephardt polltaker ed reilly contended that because of intensive 
television coverage of the candidates whereever they are gephardt 
can campaign in south dakota and wyoming and still attract 
attention in the process in the southern states where so many 
delegates are at stake 
time spent doing media markets in the south is an wellspent 
in these states there will be a focus on these events he said 
gephardt won 20 percent of the vote tuesday in new hampshires 
leadoff primary behind dukakis who finished with 37 percent 
it was far from a victory but gephardt celebrated as if it were 
one because he ran ahead of fellow midwesterner simon and the rest 
of the field simon had predicted he would best gephardt in new 
hampshire and his third place finish with 18 percent put him in 
danger of being unable to raise the money necessary to sustain his 
indebted candidacy 
gephardt said gore and jackson will be tough opponents in the 
south but he portrayed himself as better able to take the battle 
to the rest of country with his message of foreign trade sanctions 
and no tax increases for low and middleincome people 
polls have shown gephardt ran particularly well among 
bluecollar and union voters in iowa and new hampshire and he is 
likely to bid for those voters in the south 
trade energy and agriculture are strong issues in the 
south he said those are issues ive defined and i think were 
going to do well there

emissions of lead into the atmosphere took 
another sharp drop in 1986 due to the reduction of lead in 
gasoline according to the annual air pollution report released 
wednesday by the environmental protection agency 
though most of the six major pollutants showed only minor 
changes from the year before lead emissions fell 59 percent an 
even sharper drop than the 47 percent seen the year before 
according to the report 
another sharp decline was seen in peak quarterly concentrations 
measured by the 82 instruments in epas lead monitoring network 
the average maximum quarterly reading fell 35 percent 
lead emissions peaked in 1976 at 169000 tons of which 146000 
tons came from the gasoline burned in cars and trucks according to 
epas estimates starting in 1975 most new cars could not use 
leaded gasoline because it would disable the new exhaust pollution 
equipment and all new cars had to use leadfree gasoline in 1980 
emissions fell to 44200 tons in 1984 and the following year 
epa started its twoyear reduction of permissible lead 
concentrations in gasoline from 11 gram per gallon to 01 gram 
that reduced emissions to 23300 tons in 1985 and 9500 tons in 
1986 
some major companies have stopped selling leaded gasoline as a 
smaller number of older cars each year may legally use it its 
share of the market shrank from 31 percent in 1986 to 26 percent in 
1987 
i would predict a continued dramatic improvement in next 
years annual report said craig potter epas assistant 
administrator for air programs 
epa has proposed removing the last lead from gasoline but 
action on that has been stalled by the fears of farmers that they 
will ruin old but still vital farm engines that need leaded 
gasoline 
lead is a poison causing kidney and brain damage in high enough 
concentrations epa believes there is new evidence it raises blood 
pressure at least in men 
it is also the cheapest way to boost gasoline octane and before 
engine manufacturers switched to hardened valve seats in 19711975 
many engines relied on lead deposits to lubricate valves the 
point that worries farmers 
epa said 45 million people unchanged from the previous years 
report lived in counties where the airborne lead concentration 
standard is violated 
those violations came near smelters the report listed these 
eight cities where the standard of 15 micrograms per cubic meter 
was exceeded for a quarter the figures are the peak quarterly 
average in micrograms per cubic meter near the smelter and the 
peak reading in a residential area 
philadelphia 172 014 st louis 570 035 minneapolis 
209 014 seattle 182 026 indianapolis 249 014 
birmingham ala 230 030 gary ind 181 016 and el paso 
texas 157 058 
there were no surprises elsewhere in the report and epa said it 
had not changed its estimate that about 100 million people live in 
counties where one or more concentration standards is violated 
here is a rundown of the other major pollutants with emissions 
from 1985 and 1986 followed by average concentrations in epas 
monitoring networks 
carbon monoxide from 709 million tons to 671 million tons 
and from 719 parts per million to 721 parts per million in the 
secondhighest eighthour average a blip upward epa considers no 
real change at all the standard is 90 ppm carbon monoxide can 
worsen heart problems since it displaces oxygen in the blood 
sulfur dioxide from 238 million tons to 234 million tons and 
from 885 micrograms per cubic meter to 864 micrograms averaged 
over the year the annual standard is 80 micrograms sulfur dioxide 
causes breathing difficulties and can turn into acid rain epa has 
revised upward slightly its estimates of emissions over the last 
nine years 
volatile organic compounds like unburned gasoline that form 
ozone from 224 million tons to 215 million tons ozone 
concentrations fell from 0127 ppm to 0123 ppm measured as the 
secondhighest onehour reading 
nitrogen dioxide which also causes breathing problems helps 
form ozone and can be transformed into acid rain from 217 million 
tons to 213 million tons and from 00251 ppm to 00248 ppm 
measured as an annual average the standard calls for 0053 ppm 
smoke dust and soot what epa calls total suspended 
particulates from 77 million tons to 75 million tons and from 
485 micrograms per cubic meter to 484 micrograms this is the 
last year total suspended particulates will be listed as a 
pollutant epa is switching to counting as a pollutant only the 
fine particles that penetrate the lung

the marine officer kidnapped in lebanon is 
one of at least 15 americans on un duty assigned to serve in a 
land so dangerous for us citizens that the state department 
declared it offlimits in 1987 
the pentagon says american officers chosen for the duty are 
under un command and it has no control over where they serve 
gunmen stopped the car of lt col william r higgins 43 on a 
south lebanon road wednesday and abducted him sources in lebanon 
said he was returning from talks with officials of a moderate 
shiite moslem militia near the port city of tyre 
twentyfour other foreigners including eight americans and two 
scandinavian un officials abducted earlier this month also are 
missing most believed to be hostages of shiite extremists 
terry anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press has been held longest he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
the united nations said higgins is one of 17 americans in the 
76person truce observer group attached to the un interim force 
in lebanon or unifil the pentagon put the number of americans at 
15 or 16 and neither could account for the discrepancy 
not all observers are on duty at a given time timur goksel 
spokesman for unifil in lebanon said only six americans actually 
were in the country 
one un official said some governments have understandings 
about where their citizens serve peacekeeping or observer duty but 
the united states apparently did not in the case of lebanon he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the united states is not involved in unifil the peacekeeping 
organization to which higgins group is attached but it has 36 
officers on observer duty in various posts with the un truce 
supervision organization a 299member force known as untso 
commanded by gen martin vadset of norway 
higgins is the senior american in untso he had been on un 
duty in the middle east since june 1987 and assumed command of the

sen alfonse damato rny still trying to 
steer his party to a candidate who could unseat democratic sen 
daniel p moynihan suggested wednesday that if rep jack kemp were 
to quit the gop presidential race he should run for new york 
senator 
but kemp spokeswoman mary brunette said kemp has absolutely no 
intention of quitting the presidential race 
we are on the move and i think its kind of absurd for sen 
damato to make that suggestion although we appreciate his 
support ms brunette added 
damatos suggestion first made late tuesday on wcbs radio in 
new york came after kemp scored a respectable third place in the 
new hampshire priamry behind vice president george bush and sen 
bob dole 
former delaware gov pete du pont and extelevision evangelist 
pat robertson trailed 
i wouldnt be presumptuous to urge jack to drop out of his 
presidential race damato said in an interview wednesday i 
think he owes it to his party to himself to those who support 
him to compete for the presidency as long as he feels he has a 
chance to win 
but if he chooses to withdraw now or even after super 
tuesday he can make an outstanding candidate and i think a winning 
candidate for the us senate 
damato said he had not discussed the idea with kemp and that 
it had only just occurred to him 
moynihan spokesman matt james asked about damatos suggestion 
replied youve got our poll results 
he was referring to a survey by moynihans campaign taken the 
first week of february showing that if kemp were to challenge 
moynihan the incumbent would be favored by 60 percent of the 
voters statewide while kemp would be the choice of 24 percent 
eight hundred voters were questioned statewide james said

the house voted wednesday to allow medical 
malpractice lawsuits against the federal government on behalf of 
activeduty military personnel who suffer injury or death because 
of negligent care at military hospitals 
the reagan administration opposes the bill sponsored by rep 
barney frank dmass on the ground that it would restrict a 
longstanding supreme court doctrine that the government is not 
liable for servicerelated injuries to members of the armed forces 
the house approved the bill on a 31261 roll call after voice 
votes approving a 300000 ceiling on the governments liability 
and rejecting a proposal to make the bills provisions retroactive 
to jan 1 1986 the bill now goes to the senate 
a virtually identical bill passed the house by a 31790 vote in 
1985 but the senate never acted on it 
the housepassed bill wednesday would cover permanent military 
hospitals but would exclude treatment at field hospitals or 
hospital ships and claims stemming from combat activities or 
foreign jurisdictions 
the measure also would prohibit claims for mental or emotional 
disabilities unless they resulted from a physical injury 
frank is chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on 
administrative law and governmental relations which had heard 
numerous witnesses testify about medical malpractice involving 
activeduty military personnel at military hospitals 
activeduty servicemen represent about onethird of those 
treated at military hospitals and are the only patients who cannot 
sue for medical malpractice 
the federal government generally is immune from being sued 
unless it gives its consent under a 1946 federal law however the 
government can be sued for acts of negligence by its employees 
while on official duty but the same law protects the government 
from legal claims stemming from wartime military combat operations 
the supreme court ruled in 1950 that the law bars activeduty 
military personnel from suing the federal government for damages 
arising from government action or inaction in other situations 
this ruling does not prohibit military dependents or retirees from 
suing the government for medical malpractice

a woman accused of killing a mental health 
caseworker and taking three people hostage at a hospitals 
psychiatric emergency room complained about mistreatment by 
doctors police said 
at an arraignment wednesday where she was charged with homicide 
and reckless endangerment edith anderson 31 asked why she was 
being charged rather than her doctors 
officers peter drummond and robert white who talked with the 
woman during the siege said she claimed doctors gave her too much 
medicine 
she kept saying things like martin luther king is not dead 
and that she felt she had not been treated right by doctors at st 
francis said white a former high school classmate of ms 
anderson 
it appears as though she has a mental history said police 
chief ralph pampena 
meanwhile the staff of st francis medical center planned a 
memorial service for monday for caseworker linda rosen 27 who was 
shot in the back tuesday night as she tried to flee miss rosen had 
worked at the hospital since may 1986 
this is a nightmare its the kind of thing psychiatric 
emergency room workers always worry about said shirley freyer 
spokeswoman for st francis 
according to ms freyer ms anderson entered the emergency room 
at 855 pm and asked a security guard where she could get 
psychiatric help 
the woman told the guard dan sterzinger she wanted to think 
before registering as a patient and she sat in the waiting area 
miss rosen sat beside her and spoke briefly with her until ms 
anderson produced a gun ms freyer said 
the victim turned and ran and started yelling for security 
guards and at that point the suspect began shooting said police 
commander ronald freeman 
miss rosen died where she fell doctors determined 
ms anderson then moved to a bathroom doorway and trained her 
gun on three people whom police declined to identify officials 
said 
i asked her to release one of the hostages but she said she 
was going to kill them drummond said

a judge wednesday disputed a published 
report accusing him of approving a huge attorneys fee for wedtech 
scandal figure e robert wallach after asking wallach to lobby for 
his federal judgeship 
the san francisco chronicle on tuesday said thensuperior court 
judge eugene lynch orally granted wallach and his partner a 1 
million fee in september 1981 while the white house was 
considering lynch for the federal bench 
lynch was appointed a us district court judge in january 1982 
wallach in 1981 was the personal attorney of attorney general 
edwin meese who at the time was a white house counselor 
lynch said he has never been improperly influenced in any 
decision during his 16 years on the bench and he added i know 
of nothing that was improper or unusual about the process of my 
appointment to the federal bench 
the fee was awarded to wallachs firm for representing two young 
sisters in a personal injury case it was reduced to 322000 in 
1982 by another judge on the grounds that it was excessive 
the article is misleading in at least one vital respect and 
should be corrected lynch said in a statement 
contrary to the storys implication lynch said it is a 
matter of public record that i did not finally approve the 
attorneys fees that were the focus of the story he said a 
different judge ultimately set the amount 
a spokesman for the judge refused to say whether the judge had 
initially approved the 1 million to wallachs firm according to 
the new york times 
lynch according to the chronicle acknowledged seeking help 
from wallach for the federal court appointment and said that 
wallach was a friend of long standing 
wallach strongly denied any connection between his endorsement 
of lynch for the judgeship and the payment of attorneys fees the 
chronicle said 
wallach was indicted last month in new york on charges of 
influence peddling for allegedly taking payments from wedtech corp 
to lobby meese before he became attorney general in order to get 
the company government contracts

resnik placed the mount at between 2 million and 35 million

the shuttle exploded 73 seconds after blastoff when a joint in 
its rightside booster leaked flame and ignited the shuttles giant 
fuel tank 
the settlement leaves one claim pending against mortonthiokol 
from the family of challenger copilot michael j smith resnik

two men sentenced to a total of 735 years 
in prison for the kidnapping and sexual molestation of two children 
asked wednesday that their convictions be overturned 
alex carbarga 23 and luis tree frog johnson 38 were 
convicted of a string of crimes that began when they snatched 
2yearold tara burke from a shopping center in concord 30 miles 
east of san francisco in february 1982 
it ended 10 months later when police broke into a dingy bread 
van parked under a san francisco freeway overpass and discovered 
tara huddled inside the other child in the case 11yearold mac 
lin had fled and alerted police 
during trial carbarga who was 18 when arrested was depicted 
by his attorney as johnsons youthful pawn and sex slave since 
carbargas parents turned their 9yearold son over to johnson 
carbarga pleaded innocent because of insanity 
his attorney alan caplan argued before the threemember panel 
of the state court of appeals that superior court judge robert 
dossee allowed testimony about carbargas tragic mental 
condition in the penalty phase of the trial but incorrectly 
prohibited it during the guilt phase 
it was really the only defense and the jury didnt know it 
he said 
carbarga was convicted on 93 of the 154 counts against him of 
the convictions 89 were felonies jurors found he was not legally 
sane at the time of 58 crimes and he was sentenced to 208 years on 
35 offenses 
a central issue is prosecution classification of some crimes as 
taking place before a change in california law that altered 
standards to determine questions such as whether a defendant knew 
the difference in right and wrong could form the required mental 
intent to commit certain crimes or could appreciate their nature 
caplan said there was a twoyear window between enactment of 
one law regarding sanity determination and a state supreme court 
ruling that the law had incorrectly stated legislative intent 
theres no way in hell this boy could have formed the intent 
required to commit these crimes he said of carbarga 
deputy attorney general robert murphy said certain technical 
problems had to be worked out at trial and have to be worked out on 
appeal 
according to caplan the appeals court could take a variety of 
actions carbarga could be tried again on the criminal offenses or 
the sanity question he could go to a mental hospital or be 
returned to juvenile court and sent to the california youth 
authority 
johnsons attorney george schraer argued for reversal of his 
clients convictions saying blacks were unfairly excluded during 
jury selection johnson is black 
schraer also said police acted without a search warrant when 
they broke into the van 
in addition he said the defense was not alowed to show 
potential jurors some of the videotapes and photographs seized and 
depicting tara and mac nude often in sexual situations 
by only describing the material he argued the defense couldnt 
reliably gauge response when potential jurors said they could 
consider the case fairly despite the evidence 
johnson convicted of 95 felonies and five misdemeanors is 
serving a 527year term

i thought he was acting very foolishly 
wards group was flown to normans cay to discuss the switch

baron had testified that lehder and his men had sprayed the home 
with automatic weapons fire

mechanics of arranging a 30day ceasefire that could lead to a 
permanent truce it says political changes will be discussed only 
after the contras have accepted an amnesty laid down their arms 
and resumed civilian life within the country 
aguero the rebel delegate said our position has not 
changed and it will not change there can be no ceasefire unless 
the sandinistas first agree to democratic reforms in nicaragua

month a week before the house of representatives voted down 
president reagans request for another 362 million in contra aid 
the rebels and the nicaraguan government each presented 
radically different proposals in a twoday session that all said

there are no medals when you come in sixth 
observed sixthplace new hampshire finisher bruce babbitt on 
wednesday nor are there headlines or chunks of money coming in 
and by days end it looked as if he and republican pete du pont 
were ready to call it quits 
we have drafted a statement said babbitt it still has 
three conclusions to it and i have to check one of the boxes he 
said but the former arizona governor conceded somebody would 
have to make a persuasive pitch to keep him in the race 
babbitt scheduled a news conference for thursday morning du 
pont who had not been heard from much after the new hampshire 
primary scheduled one in the afternoon 
if you write a story that indicates were going to bow out 
youll be ok said a dupont campaign source 
only the presidential candidates named bush dole dukakis and 
gephardt didnt have to face questions about their steadfastness in 
the wake of the first primary a strong third in this contest 
wasnt good enough according to sen paul simon dill 
it makes a huge difference said simon on nbcs today 
show first of all in media momentum the headlines in the 
morning newspaper have his name rather than mine it makes a great 
deal of difference in money the he was richard gephardt who 
bested simon 20 percent to 18 percent in the democratic contest 
the winner of course was massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
whose finish in his neighboring state came as no surprise 
simon said he has to win either the minnesota caucus or the 
south dakota primary next tuesday to stay in 
i cannot continue to run second and third in various 
primaries he said you have to win somewhere and theres no 
sense in fooling myself or fooling those who follow me 
so simon gave himself another week babbitt said he was of 
divided mind on what to do 
i will indulge myself the luxury of agonizing no more than 24 
hours he said leaving new hampshire for washington my mood 
this morning is plaid there are no medals for sixth 
he planned to spend the day on the telephone what im going 
to ask my frinds is you know can i or should i throw it in and 
acknowledge reality 
one mans reality however was another mans vindication 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee who didnt campaign as 
intensely as the other democrats in new hampshire looked forward 
to the super tuesday primaries next month when 1307 democratic 
delegates will be picked in 20 states 
we made a decision not to spend 1 million on two or three 
delegates he said were saving that for the 1400 delegates 
here in the super tuesday states he called the results in new 
hampshire and last week in iowa inconclusive 
jesse jackson who came in fourth in new hampshire with 8 
percent of the vote said the two contests so far proved we could 
broaden our base 
among white families he was asked by kathleen sullivan of abcs 
good morning 
white families replied jackson weve found where that 
point of challenge is it is that at the plant gate which closed on 
workers without notice as in kenosha wis where theres a 
closure with too little notice or where farmers are losing their 
farms when they do that the lights are cut off and people look 
amazingly similar in the dark 
and gary hart last among seven democrats with 4 percent took 
comfort in doing 500 percent better than iowa where he barely 
got 1 percent 
we have just begun we are committed he said 
on the republican side jack kemp saw his thirdplace finish as 
a victory in a race for conservatives among himself pat 
robertson and pete du pont the other race was one for the 
traditional moderate wing of the party between vice president 
george bush who won new hampshire and sen bob dole who came in 
second 
finally weve dragged bush and dole out of discussing their 
resumes and their tax returns and where theyre born and into 
discussing issues kemp said 
du pont returned home to wilmington del late last night and 
wasnt saying much publicly about his 10 percent of the vote and 
what it meant to his future as a presidential candidate his office 
said he was meeting with advisers presumably discussing that 
question 
were solvent right now and we have enough money to run the 
campaign for another two weeks said du pont press secretary fred 
stern 
for his part robertson also was looking to super tuesday to 
overcome a 9 percent showing dead last in new hampshire 
theyre going to be playing in my backyard he said and 
addressing bush and dole the virginiaborn robertson said im 
going to beat you there convincingly

the iowa supreme court ruled wednesday 
that courts have the power to order sterilization of the mentally 
retarded but declined to spell out guidelines for deciding when it 
is appropriate 
a dissenting justice said the court was walking into a legal 
morass 
in a narrowly drawn opinion seven justices agreed that courts 
can act on a request that retarded people be sterilized even though 
a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977 
we conclude that our district courts possess subject matter 
jurisdiction over and accordingly may hear and determine 
applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentally 
incapacitated ward such as that involved here the high court 
said in an opinion written by justice bruce snell 
in his dissent justice k david harris said the court was 
wandering into a subject shot through with searching social and 
ethical questions 
in taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself to 
the eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendant 
social and ethical issues harris wrote future litigants 
faced with unanswered questions of great social and ethical 
dimensions or with missing ingredients of a vague application 
process will continue to press us for determinations we are 
singularly unfit to reach 
the majority rejected that reasoning 
we do not believe our courts lack jurisdiction over a case 
merely because the case is important or unavoidably includes a 
constitutional dimension the court said as always we must 
remain mindful that a court cannot escape the demands of judging or 
of making difficult appraisals 
the decision came in a polk county case involving jan and tekla 
matejski who are legal guardians of their 33yearold mentally 
retarded daughter court records said 
the couple filed an application with a lower court seeking 
authorization to have their daughter sterilized but a lawyer 
appointed by the court to represent the daughters interests argued 
that there was no provision in iowa law for sterilization 
polk county judge glenn e pille agreed and dismissed the 
application 
both sides appealed 
lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the legislature 
repealed a law providing for sterilization of people who are 
mentally ill or retarded syphilitic habitual criminals moral 
degenerates or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society 
while agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests the 
high court refused to set guidelines about when it would be 
appropriate 
we are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given the 
posture of the present case the court said the excursion 
suggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisory 
opinion 
the high court did not indicate why the parents wanted their 
daughter sterilized 
harris wrote that the courts decision would return to haunt it 
at what level of mental retardation can sterilization be 
compelled harris asked what board or body if any will 
suggest statewide standards 
the good news is that the majority in its obvious and wise 
recognition of its inability to do so chooses not to address these 
questions harris wrote the bad news is that the majority 
consigns them to iowas individual trial judges for ad hoc 
determinations 
iowas trial courts must now face these and undoubtedly a 
host of other public policy decisions 
the leading us supreme court case on the issue was buck vs 
bell in 1927 in which the court upheld a virginia law that 
provided for the sterilization of institutionalized retarded 
persons the decision set guidelines including the appointment of a 
guardian a hearing and the right of appeal 
more than 7500 persons were sterilized before virginia 
abandoned the program in 1972 according to state records cited by 
the washington post in 1980 in 1981 the virginia legislature 
enacted new guidelines for judges deciding sterilization cases 
in other cases in recent years 
in 1985 the california supreme court struck down a law enacted 
in 1980 that banned sterilization of retarded persons the 
following year a santa clara county superior court judge 
authorized sterilization of a 31yearold woman who had downs 
syndrome the operation was sought by her parents 
in 1984 the us supreme court killed a 3 million lawsuit 
filed by a woman who had been sterilized at age 14 the woman had 
sought damages from the north carolina eugenics board which 
approved the surgery in 1974 on the grounds that the woman was 
mentally retarded 
a federal appeals court in virginia had ordered a trial of the 
suit but a us district court jury in new bern nc a jury 
rejected her claim 
in 1981 the new jersey supreme court ruled that incompetent 
individuals could be sterilized only if a court determined that the 
operation appeared to be in the best interest of the patient and if 
procedural safeguards had been followed the ruling came in a case 
involving a 19yearold woman wit

act like an officer and a gentleman 
he loves his country he is capable of standing up as well as 
an ordinary man will under the circumstances i dont think

country in any way i think he would die first said delbert 
eagle uncle of lt col william r higgins 
higgins father william f higgins was extremely ill in a 
louisville hospital wednesday the pentagon said higgins had come 
home this fall on emergency leave to visit his father 
its been very trying times because weve been here at the 
hospital off and on for two weeks then we hear this if one 
things bad two is worse said harold fisher whose wife mary 
is the marine officers sister 
mary fisher told whastv that she called her brothers wife 
marine maj robin higgins in woodbridge va wednesday morning to 
tell her to get him home from lebanon as soon as possible so he 
could see his father before he died that is when she learned of 
the abduction 
fisher said the elder higgins is too ill to understand what 
happened to his son 
the man has not opened his eyes in a couple of days theres 
no way he could be able to comprehend although he may be able to 
hear he said 
the pentagon said higgins 43 was on temporary detail serving 
as the chief of the un truce supervision organizations lebanon 
observer group 
un sources said higgins was kidnapped in the late afternoon on

in various staff positions at marine corps headquarters in 
washington and at the pentagon and graduated from the national war 
college in 1985 
a high school friend said students at southern were surprised 
when higgins went into the marines 
you think of the marines as being machotype and he really 
wasnt like that but he seems to have done all right at it said 
rudy fischer now a lab technician at rohm and haas chemical co in 
louisville 
he was involved in a lot of social activities played football 
and was one of the top students in the class fischer said

other drugs according to an autopsy report released wednesday 
bissell 30 was found dead dec 29 in his apartment in hoboken 
across the hudson river from manhattan 
hudson county prosecutor paul m depascale said investigators 
found significant quantities of dangerous substances in 
bissells body among the substances were ethanol painkillers and 
salicylate a component of aspirin the autopsy said

found he said the case was being closed because it was unlikely 
investigators could trace the source of the drugs 
the prosecutor said in december that authorities suspected a 
drug overdose but that an autospy and toxicology tests would be 
needed to determine an official cause of bissells death

secretary of state george shultz sought 
support wednesday for his proposals to revive the moribund mideast 
peace process meeting with israeli envoy abba eban and members of 
the senate 
shultz who leaves for moscow late this week will travel to the 
middle east at the end of the month to try to push arab and israeli 
leaders toward the negotiating table 
shultz appears encouraged by the support hes gotten so far 
for his proposals eban told reporters following a 30minute 
meeting with the secretary but he added that the positions of 
the various sides are still far apart and one should not expect the 
ice to melt right away 
eban said he supports shultzs initiative and the high degree 
of his activism i dont think this is just a symbolic effort and 
that the americans will withdraw afterward this is a serious 
initiative 
shultz is laying the groundwork for the next us administration 
to continue mediation efforts between arabs and israelis eban said 
eban is a member of the labor party headed by foreign minister 
shimon peres who favors the shultz plan his rival in the 
coalition government prime minister yitzhak shamir has expressed 
some reservations 
eban said he hopes shultz can overcome shamirs hesitancy 
at the capitol sen alan cranston dcalif said shultz did 
not outline any magic solution or precise plan for dealing with 
the problems of the middle east other than to say he would devote 
himself to the search for a breakthrough 
cranston said shultz did provide assurances that contrary to 
some reports egyptian president hosni mubarak is not opting out of 
the peace process 
the senator said shultz responding to a question said the 
united states has urged israel not to use undue violence in 
dealing with rebellious palestinians but also has expressed 
understanding that some strength is needed to deal with the 
situation 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said he believes 
that it is high time shultz visited the area in an attempt to 
revitalize the peace process 
what we see going on there is a tragic situation and what we 
see on our newscasts every evening certainly doesnt go over very 
well with the american people byrd said 
shultz met tuesday night with some 25 members of the house to 
present his proposals and arranged to lay out his plans for 
senators wednesday night 
the plan he will propose in his mideast talks has not been made 
public but it reportedly calls for arabisraeli negotiations to 
start in april on an interim autonomy agreement for the 15 million 
palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
it envisions that talks on the permanent fate of the territories 
would begin in december 
several arab leaders have rejected the interim solution included 
in the shultz proposal while shamir opposes the notion of 
negotiating for a permanent solution shamir fears that such talks 
would force israel to give back the lands it captured from the 
arabs in the 1967 middle east war 
shultzs reengagement in the peace process was sparked by two 
months of rioting in the occupied territories in which at least 53 
palestinians have been killed

a union official whose cooperation was 
considered crucial to saving the new york post boycotted 
labormanagement negotiations wednesday with a deadline for 
closing the paper two days away 
jerry cronin president of the 350member drivers union did 
not join the negotiations both sides had said agreement was 
impossible without the cooperation of his union 
late in the day the post announced that arbitrator thomas g 
christensen a labor law professor at new york university had 
denied a petition by the drivers union to stop the paper from 
closing feb 19 
the union argued that the post was required by contract to give 
30 days notice of any change in work rules rubenstein said 
christensen decided that the rule did not apply if the paper was 
closing 
the newspaper hopes that the drivers will now work with them 
in reaching an agreement said howard rubenstein a spokesman for 
the post 
cronin could not be reached for comment 
earlier labor lawyer theodore w kheel who is advising the 
newspapers union had said theres no chance of a settlement 
before friday 
the talks between management and nine post unions at the grand 
hyatt hotel were scheduled to continue around the clock until the 2 
pm friday deadline set by post owner rupert murdoch who has 
demanded 24 million in union concessions over three years 
after meeting for 35 minutes both sides broke for lunch and 
consultations george mcdonald president of the allied printing 
trades council said they had discussed the concession figure and 
told reporters i feel optimistic we all had smiles in there i 
think 
if the unions refuse to go along with the concessions murdoch 
has said his 37 million sale of the paper to real estate developer 
peter kalikow will collapse and the paper will close 
participants in the talks included post publisher patrick 
purcell and other post executives mcdonald and leaders from most 
of the eight unions which constitute the trades council 
purcell had no comment after the brief meeting 
one union leader lenny higgins of the pressmens union said 
one goal was to extend the deadline if he murdoch stays with 
the friday deadline i dont know whatll happen he said 
under the terms of his contract with kalikow murdoch has until 
monday to negotiate the union concessions 
murdoch opted to sell the post after congress passed legislation 
preventing crossownership of a newspaper and a television station 
in the same city murdoch also owns wnywtv in new york he faces a 
similar crossownership situation in boston 
murdoch claims he has lost nearly 150 million since purchasing 
the post 11 years ago

michael dukakis headed fullspeed from the 
northeast into a southern campaign wednesday spending the day 
after his new hampshire triumph talking tough on military issues in 
a region where he hopes to take his next big step toward the 
democratic nomination 
the massachusetts governor who won a lopsided victory over six 
democratic rivals in new hampshire on tuesday left new england at 
dawn and was in atlanta and campaigning while his triumph was still 
fresh 
in the next three weeks he will be spending much time and 
money in the south where 14 states will have their primaries on 
march 8 known as super tuesday 
dukakis more liberal than many southern democrats put a heavy 
emphasis on the military after a speech in atlanta declaring he 
would use force to stop a foreign aggressor in this hemisphere or 
to counterattack terrorists 
im a very tough guy when it comes to terrorism he said 
i dont yield on toughness to al gore in any shape or 
manner he added in a reference to the tennessee senator who has 
staked his campaign on doing well in the south 
dukakis said his emphasis on defense issues had nothing to do 
with any southern strategy but came simply because i was asked 
about it he also said some issues are more important to some 
regions than others adding the south for many years has been 
the location for many military installations 
his speech to about 500 spectators was essentially the same as 
his victory speech in manchester tuesday night dukakis used the 
words strong or strength 14 times in a 15minute address 
former kentucky gov martha layne collins and former new orleans 
mayor dutch morial endorsed dukakis in his atlanta appearance 
collins said that she and her fellow governors used to say of 
dukakis now theres something worth watching 
dukakis said the idea that the south is politically different 
from the rest of the nation is a false image created by the press 
theres a mythology about the south as if its some kind of 
foreign country its nonsense dukakis said 
in his victory speech the previous night dukakis said i have 
no southern strategy 
but his aides say his campaign will focus on texas florida 
north carolina and georgia the four southern states with the most 
delegates to the democratic national convention 
the bottom line is delegates thats what were looking for 
super tuesday said alice travis dukakis national political 
coordinator 
dukakis also is expected to do well in his home state in 
neighboring rhode island and in washington state all of which also 
have contests on march 8 
john dukakis who is running his fathers southern campaign 
said florida texas north carolina and georgia are places where 
we started early those are the four largest states but were 
everywhere and moving quickly 
in clearwater fla dukakis told about 600 cheering supporters 
i dont have to tell you how important florida is going be 
dukakis has led in recent polls in florida which ranks second 
among super tuesday states with 135 democratic delegates 
he also fired a shot across gores bow when told the tennesssee 
senator had accused his opponents of being alienated from the 
electorate 
mr gore left iowa virtually left new hampshire dukakis 
said i dont know whos alienated 
dukakis made it clear wednesday that he would continue to 
contrast his positions with those of missouri rep richard 
gephardt who finished second to dukakis in new hampshire after 
beating him in iowa 
on foreign trade one of gephardts main issues dukakis said 
a portion of the problem has to do with unfair trade practices 
but he also said the federal budget deficit is the primary culprit 
and he said gephardt helped create the problem by voting for 
president reagans 1981 tax cut 
in one strategic uncertainty dukakis aides say that between 
now and super tuesday the democratic field could narrow forcing a 
more direct comparison of the remaining candidates 
during the new hampshire campaign dukakis said negative 
campaigning by his oppoents failed miserably when you have many 
candidates in a race trying to strike out at a number of them 
doesnt work 
the 20 caucuses and primaries on super tuesday including 14 in 
the south wont come to dukakis as easily as new hampshire his 
aides recognize 
in new hampshire next door to his home state dukakis had 
hundreds of volunteers in the south a paid staff of 64 in 15 
offices is seeking to create a new volunteer corps 
florida with its northeastern transplants and jewish 
population texas with its hispanic vote and north carolina with 
its concentration of high technology industries will be places 
where dukakis campaigns hard said aide travis 
dukakis wife kitty is jewish 
the dukakis game plan combines an emphasis on economic growth 
and opportunity with strengthening of the nations conventional 
military force 
politically dukakis is hoping that the credibility he gains 
from winning new hampshire and from hopedfor good showings in the 
minnesota caucus and south dakota primary on feb 22 will make up 
for any disadvantage created by his ethnic and geographic origin 
john dukakis said his fathers greek background and immigrant 
parents may be an initial hurdle at times in the south but he 
said people pronounce his name just fine people are looking way 
beyond that 
bostonbased political consultant michael goldman said dukakis 
campaign sources tell him the governor will spend between 3 
million and 4 million in the south to spread his message across 
such a large region and john dukakis said the ads would begin with 
a biographical series to introduce the candidate to voters

the arizona senate on wednesday granted 
gov evan mecham a oneweek delay of his impeachment trial set to 
begin monday 
the action came on a voice vote earlier in the day the senate 
defeated two motions for delay offered by the embattled governors 
attorney murray miller 
arizonas chief justice frank gordon who will preside at the 
impeachment trial told the senate a oneweek delay would 
ultimately save time by allowing some issues to be settled 
beforehand 
however sen majority leader bob usdane said there is an 
ongoing fear that this will be the beginning of lots of motions 
for continuation by miller 
miller had asked that the trial be put off until criminal 
charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan are adjudicated he 
contended that an impeachment trial would prejudice the criminal 
trial jury 
but a motion to delay the trial until 20 days after the criminal 
case is resolved lost on a voice vote and a motion to delay the 
senate proceeding a flat 90 days went down 245 with five 
republicans supporting the governor 
after the oneweek delay passed miller would not say whether he 
would go to court in an effort to obtain a further delay he told 
the senate on tuesday that if the trial was not delayed he would 
go to state or federal court 
before the two earlier votes wednesday senate majority leader 
bob usdane a republican had said i think we need to expedite 
the trial 
minority leader alan stephens agreed saying his millers 
game is delay thats his middle name 
at least 72 people are considering challenging mecham in a 
recall election may 17 including a former congressman and a former 
state school superintendent who lost to the republican in 1986 
the house impeached mecham on feb 5 and accused him of 
concealing the 350000 loan misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership and trying to 
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state 
official 
wednesday was the first day for recall election candidates to 
file petition signatures aimed at getting placed on the ballot 
mecham will automatically be put on the ballot but all other 
candidates must file 3336 signatures of registered voters by march 
18 
by midday wednesday nobody had turned in any petition 
signatures but 72 had picked up packets to collect signatures 
the most prominent names among them are those of democrat 
carolyn warner who lost to mecham in a threeway gubernatorial 
race in 1986 and former rep john rhodes who planned to announce 
friday whether he would run 
but some of the lesser knowns among the prospective candidates 
also insist they have a shot at unseating mecham 
dave colosimo of phoenix a former teacher and musician said 
if i didnt think i could win i wouldnt run he has never 
sought public office before and admitted his campaign thus far was 
a oneman show 
frank vaupell a phoenix mortgage loan officer acknowledged he 
has no real chance of winning asked why he was running he said 
i shouldnt be theres probably much more qualified people 
republican national committeeman jack londen also said he will 
run so voters will have a choice of a conservative candidate in 
case mecham is barred from running in the recall if mecham is 
convicted by the senate lawmakers could vote to bar him from 
holding any future public office 
londen said he would pull out if mecham stays on the ballot

the battle raged in and around this provincial capital of 70000 
people 70 miles southeast of san salvador the capital 
military officers said two detachments of about 300 leftist 
insurgents each took part in the coordinated attacks which 
included blowing up two bridges linking the capital and usulutan 
el salvadors eastern province

were wounded

napoleon duarte of selling national sovereignty to the united 
states 
the attacks effect was evident well into the afternoon trucks 
full of soldiers with m16 assault rifles sped along dusty roads 
helicopters and spotter planes flew overhead 
montano said the guerrillas retreated to the north toward san 
vicente volcano on whose slopes insurgents camp 
lt mejia at the cotton cooperative said the attack there began 
with about 15 minutes of mortar fire 
then they attacked shouting like indians he said on the 
porch of the cooperatives offices they shouted at us to 
surrender calling to me by my name that it was useless to resist

the front of the cooperative but guerrilla fighters penetrated 
from the sides and rear seven of the units opensided warehouses

to 500 percent for a list of 33 basic staples and raised salaries 
up to five times above their december levels 
the government said it sought to curb inflation which reached 
1500 percent in 1987 
but prices for many basic goods suddenly jumped beyond their 
official levels this week even at government sales booths that 
ration the commodities 
a carton of 30 eggs that went for the equivalent of 15 new 
cordobas last week rose to 50 cordobas at the government booths 
and fetched 60 in the black market meat prices also shot up 
a liter about a quart of cooking oil that sold for 37 
cordobas in the government booths last week rose to 12 this week 
in the black market the price per liter went from 100 to 150 
cordobas 
thousands of people were angered with the new prices according 
to a new radio channel the government set up last weekend to 
explain the reforms 
one resident of the villa libertad district in the east of 
managua complained that a tiny corn tortilla smaller than a 
hand now costs a full cordoba double what it did before the 
currency swap 
soft drinks that used to cost 3 cordobas now cost 15 even 
though the governments fixed price was ten he complained 
newspapers also raised their prices the opposition daily la 
prensa which formerly cost the equivalent of two new cordobas 
sold for ten wednesday barricada the government daily sold for 
five cordobas up from one last week nicaraguans were only allowed 
to cash in 10 million cordobas those arrested for currency 
violations face up to six months in prison 
tijerino the police chief said various vehicles from the 
american embassy were surprised giving personnel at an exchange 
house packets that supposedly contained money 
he said the law mandates all foreign embassy personnel change 
their old currency at the foreign ministry 
it was not clear whether the embassy employees were americans

the obscure cargo airline that eastern 
airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces 
questions about its safety record as the government decides whether 
it is fit to carry passengers 
few air travelers have ever heard of orion air a north carolina 
cargo carrier which serves such air freight companies as united 
parcel service emery air freight and purolator 
but if labor strife intensifies at eastern many of that 
airlines customers may find themselves with tickets to fly orion 
and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up 
scrutiny of the airline 
recently eastern entered into an agreement with orion including 
the leasing of 26 of easterns jetliners that call on the airline 
to take over much of easterns routes if pilots and mechanics go on 
strike orion would fly the eastern planes with its own pilots and 
ground workers eastern officials said 
but the faa has yet to approve orion for passenger service and 
a senior agency official said tuesday that an enforcement 
proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against 
orion because of past safety violations

if the trend by many taxpayers to delay filing

were filed in january and 34 percent in april but last year only 
4 percent were filed during the first month and almost 40 percent 
in april 
if this trend were exacerbated by tax reform the sweeping 
1986 law it could jam the system by slowing down processing and 
the issuance of refunds gibbs told a senate finance subcommittee 
tuesday as a result there could be a high price to pay

pierce brosnan whod never been to asia 
before started last year with a miniseries in hong kong and ended 
it with a movie in india 
in between he returned to his native ireland to do an 
independent film with some friends 
the miniseries noble house starts its eighthour 
fourpart run on nbc this sunday its based on the bestselling 
book by james clavell 
the movie in india is the deceivers from the book by john 
masters the irish movie is taffin 
in noble house brosnan stars as ian dunross the taipan 
or boss of hong kongs leading trading house it also stars 
deborah raffin ben masters john houseman john rhysdavies and 
julia nickson gary nelson directed it on location in hong kong for 
12 weeks and at the dino de laurentiis studio in north carolina for 
another 12 weeks 
hong kong was my first step into the orient said brosnan 
its a fascinating place sort of a condensed version of new york 
city my schedule was such that i had time to go around and see the 
place i bought an automatic camera and did some photography 
what was around me was so exciting to look at and so 
different the colors and the light were magical having started 
life as a commercial artist ive always looked at things as though 
to paint them i used a zoom lens because the chinese dont like 
having their pictures taken 
as the story opens dunross has just taken over the familys 
trading empire 
hes fairly ruthless in his dealings with people said 
brosnan he has a remoteness to him an isolated charm ive 
never played a character like him before the job came at a very 
opportune moment after the whole incident of james bond and 
remington steele 
after nbc canceled remington steele a few seasons back 
brosnan was asked to become the next james bond roger moore had 
decided to step down as 007 then because of the publicity over 
bond nbc put remington steele back on the schedule and 
brosnan was dropped from the bond picture 
did he see the offer of the role in noble house as a peace 
offering 
i never thought of it as a peace offering he answered i 
saw it as a way of putting as much distance between myself and 
remington steele as possible id always enjoyed doing the 
series but i knew coming back for six more episodes was hogwash 
they wanted to have their cake and eat it 
the turmoil for me was the on and off anxiety of the bond 
part it lasted an eternity i was offered james bond i said yes 
remington steele was brought back thats enough to say on the 
subject it was a shame because remington steele was never 
allowed to finish with any grace 
as it turned out timothy dalton was hired to play james bond in 
the living daylights brosnan said he sees no chance that he 
will ever play the role 
his wife cassandra harris was moores leading lady in the bond 
movie for your eyes only 
brosnans india movie the deceivers is set in 1824 and 
focuses on the thugs who worshipped the god of destruction kali 
i play an englishman a glorified accountant working for the 
east india trading co he said he discovers this cult and 
disguises himself as an indian he goes on the road with the thugs 
who kill people by strangulation 
brosnans only current appearances on tv are in a commercial for 
diet coke which was premiered during the super bowl coverage it 
was filmed on a speeding train in england and looks like a scene 
right out of a spy thriller such as a bond movie or perhaps the 
fourth protocol in which brosnan played a soviet agent being 
tracked down by michael caine 
that was me walking on top of that train he said it was 
going 40 miles an hour if id fallen off that sucker id never 
have done the deceivers

kevin spacey who has been wowing tv audiences 
with his portrayal of brilliant bedeviled bad guy mel profitt on 
cbs wiseguy had a tough act to follow 
ray sharkey had created one of the seasons best villains in 
sonny steelgrave a tough new jerseybased crime boss who turned 
out to be so lovable that undercover hero vinnie terranova ken 
wahl wept when he died 
but steelgrave was gone and vinnie had to have a new 
investigation 
enter mel and susan profitt joan severance a bizarre 
brothersister act with an international crime syndicate and a 
vaguely incestuous relationship 
mel a manicdepressive with a genius iq gets his 
selfdestruction wish in mondays episode the finite role is what 
appealed to spacey 
i was really attracted to be able to go and do a role for a 
number of weeks find out what it was like to do a tv series but 
not be tied to one create a character that hopefully will be 
memorable and get out spacey said recently back home in 
manhattan 
you know the crew theyre the biggest critics they not only 
were in love with the character sonny steelgrave they knew ray 
and they hung out with ray and they were like rays pal and 
here was this new york actor coming in 
by his last day on the set spacey said one of the crew 
members came up and said you know when you came on we thought 
no one would ever make us forget uh whats his name i 
thought that was a really great compliment 
if spacey won over the wiseguy crew he also won over 
audiences back in new york he said people were stopping him on 
the street and quoting lines from the show to him 
wiseguy premiered last fall on thursday opposite nbcs 
highrated lineup so it didnt get much attention but with the 
introduction of the profitts midseason cbs moved it to monday 
night where it is doing better 
spacey a dedicated new york stage actor had little screen time 
before the series he starred on broadway in hurly burly and 
later with jack lemmon in long days journey into night a 
performance that can be seen later this season on pbs he worked 
with lemmon again in nbcs recent miniseries the murder of mary 
phagan spacey played a newspaper reporter 
he has a movie due out in april rocket gibraltar in which 
he plays burt lancasters son a standup comic spacey in fact 
did standup as an impressionist in los angeles his specialty is 
johnny carson but he also does a mean katharine hepburn 
spacey went to vancouver to shoot wiseguy a number of film 
projects have moved to canada because of lower production costs 
i travel with a large black labrador named slate spacey 
said my dogs traveled all over the world and hes this 
incredible like east side dog i found him as a stray in 81 and 
i hate hotel life its too busy so i went on the hunt and found 
this great apartment very quiet and secluded down near the largest 
park in vancouver stanley park i thought great no actors 
nobody knows about it 
i get in the elevator the first day im living there and 
katharine hepburn is standing in it 
hepburn was shooting an nbc movie spacey notes casually that he 
and hepburn knew each other already 
when he was 15 spacey said he saw hepburn in a los angeles 
production of a matter of gravity he waited for her in the 
parking lot with a bouquet of flowers the gesture won him a few 
precious minutes with the actress 
after a performance of long days journey hepburn came 
backstage to congratulate the actors spacey said he was too choked 
up to mention their meeting of years before 
but the next day he sent her another bouquet with a letter he 
got a note back he said which in typical hepburn style noted it 
was the first time she had received flowers for simply attending 
the theater not performing since then the two have stayed in 
touch

since the wall street crash last fall many 
savers and investors have been taking a closer look at bond mutual 
funds as an alternative to stock funds 
bond prices and bond fund net asset values have generally been 
rising since october as interest rates have fallen 
in fact most analysts agree one reason for that trend has been 
strong demand for bonds by investors large and small who have been 
scared away from the stock market 
but if bonds and bond funds are the trendy thing right now do 
they make sense as a place to put your money if you arent 
particularly interested in high current income from your savings 
does the prospective reward match up well with the risks involved 
the overall return bond funds will produce in the future depends 
to a significant extent on such imponderables as what happens to 
interest rates and the economy 
if you think the nation is headed for a calamitous deflationary 
recession a fund investing in treasury bonds would seem a logical 
bet 
the bonds are backed by a guarantee from the federal government 
and should circumstances ever reach the point that the united 
states defaults on its obligations just about all other domestic 
investments with the possible exception of gold will surely be in 
terrible shape as well 
if on the other hand you think a financial armageddon isnt in 
the cards the question is more problematical a study just 
conducted by burt berry a san francisco investment adviser may 
give you some pause before investing in a highquality bond fund 
in his newsletter noload fund x berry compared the performance 
of four different types of funds over the 10year period that ended 
dec 31 
that would seem a good test period in that it included a couple 
of recessions an energy crisis a nearpanic on inflation a long 
bull market for stocks and as a finale a market crash 
especially pertinent for bonds it also contained spells of both 
high and rising interest rates and low and falling interest rates 
to represent the stock market berry chose the vanguard 500 
index trust a mutual fund set up to track as closely as possible 
the ups and downs of the standard amp poors 500stock composite 
index each 100 invested in that fund at the end of 1977 grew to 
389 a decade later for an annual compound growth rate of 146 
percent 
as a gauge of the performance of highyielding lowerrated 
bonds widely known as junk bonds he picked the fidelity 
high income fund which increased a 100 investment over the 10 
years to 323 for an annual compound growth rate of 124 percent 
from the ranks of the highquality bond funds the vanguard 
fixed income securities investment grade portfolio increased 100 
to 254 which translates to annual compound growth of 98 percent 
in the same span the reserve fund a money market fund turned 
100 into 258 producing annual growth of 99 percent 
a comparison of the last two funds is striking holders of the 
highquality bond fund were not compensated for the constant risk 
they faced of fluctuations in the funds net asset value the 
return they received failed even to match what investors got from 
the money fund which normally has a constant net asset value 
this said berry raises the question whether bond funds 
except for high yield bond funds merit the additional risk 
compared to money funds or the stock market

meet richard m marcus the gourmet 
peanutbutter entrepreneur whos nuts about his job 
i come in here every day and think thank god this is 
marvelous its the most exciting thing ive ever done in my life 
somedays im just bursting he says before climbing a metal 
ladder and ducking his head into a 700pound vat of dryroasted 
peanuts 
marcus is a former symphony conductor piano teacher and nursery 
school administrator who spent the better part of his adult life 
yearning for the gooey oldfashioned taste of the peanut butter he 
remembered from childhood 
which is why he started grinding peanut butter in his wifes 
blender 25 years ago 
and it is why he sells a couple of million dollars worth of his 
speciality peanut butter in supermarkets gourmet shops and 
healthfood stores from maryland to connecticut 
i was making it and giving it to my friends my students my 
dentist in little 1ounce jars listen 1 ounces of peanut 
butter is a lot of work when youre making it by hand anyway 
people kept saying you ought to sell this said the 
58yearold president of cr foods inc during a recent interview 
he paused to look at several onepound jars of crazy richards 
peanut butter that line his paneled office at the camden county 
plant then breaking into a rich belly laugh he shrugged who 
knew 
certainly not marcus who studied conducting with leonard 
bernstein and toured as the musical director of the royal winnipeg 
ballet before coming home to philadelphia to teach piano to 
children 
but even as he toured the world as a musician he kept looking 
for a peanut butter made from just plain 100 percent peanuts just 
like it says today on every one of his brownandorange labels 
the truth is it really doesnt require those additives peanut 
butter does not have to be salted sweetened or stabilized what 
the hecks wrong with the oil rising to the top just take a table 
knife and stir it down meanwhile what you have is a purer form of 
food he said 
he learned he wasnt the only person who liked his specialty 
line of peanut butter made sans sugar salt and oil 
in 1973 he started making his peanut butter with the help of a 
plant in conshocken pa a suburb of philadelphia 
by 1979 he sold a private school which he had started in 
philadelphia and turned to making peanut butter full time first at 
a rented facility in pennsauken and now at the plant he bought last 
year in this new jersey suburb of philadelphia 
in his first year he sold 18000 cases now he says hes 
selling more than twice that amount annually 
we will sell between threequarters of a million to 1 million 
jars this year its very exciting especially when you realize 
this is something i started in the back of my car with 144 jars 
he said 
the kitchen blender has long been retired and replaced by a 1910 
grinding machine that churns out about 4000 gallons of crazy 
richards peanut butter on a good day when the line is running and 
all eight of the plants employees are on hand 
this machine doesnt know how to make modernday peanut 
butter it couldnt even if we wanted to said marcus who 
stopped eating the modern stuff in the 1940s when homogenization 
was introduced to peanut butter manufacturing 
homogenization breaks down the fat particles and blends the fat 
throughout the rest of the product marcus unhomogenized peanut 
butter has swirls of oil floating on top which in his words 
defines real peanut butter 
marcus says the homogenizing process altered once and for 
all the taste of peanut butter in america 
sometimes im amazed there was no public outcry he said 
everything was homogenized in those days nobody knew what it 
meant but if it didnt have it they wouldnt buy it he said 
there are three products in his line creamy chunky and 
chocolateflavored peanut butter none is homogenized all are his 
favorites 
i usually have it for breakfast if you have it for breakfast 
you dont need lunch it really quells the appetite he said 
while briskly strolling past pallets piled with burlap bags of 
peanuts or cardboard cases of the finished product 
he attributes much of his success to entering the market just at 
a time when the backtonature movement was emerging in the 1970s 
processing changes the consistency and flavor of food here 
you get it in the natural state he said adding that luck also 
seemed to play a major role in his success 
crazy richard although a regional food product is slowly 
expanding its market it opened its national mailorder business in 
december with three small advertisments in the new yorker magazine 
according to marcus the calls are still coming in

cadet julianna klejnot is out of uniform 
this day at norwich university and thats unprecedented in the 
168year history of the oldest private military college in the 
united states 
instead of her standard green skirt and shirt she is wearing 
blue jeans and a pink cotton warmup jacket shes one of three 
cadets on a work detail winterizing a widows home off campus 
the cadets form a peace corps squad that has invaded the 
military college in a pilot program designed to prepare students in 
their junior and senior years for the peace corps or other 
volunteer relief agencies 
the program the only one of its kind in the nation is intended 
as an alternative to campus rotc and eventually military service 
norwich and peace corps officials hope other colleges will 
follow suit and that the federal government will join with the 
schools and finance the training effort as it has done with rotc 
military training on 400 campuses other schools already have made 
inquiries to norwich 
a bill is pending in congress that would authorize 5 million a 
year for five years to enable the peace corps to test the program 
at other schools norwich went ahead on its own and added the peace 
corps to its curriculum last september and will foot the cost 
itself 
the peace corps is campaigning to double its volunteers to 
10000 by 1992 and has challenged colleges to find ways to help 
because of programs like the one in norwich we will be able 
to reach that goal said james c flanigan peace corps press 
officer in washington 
lewis greenstein the peace corps liaison with universities 
called the norwich pilot program a promising model for other 
colleges and the forerunner of a federally sponsored plan of 
incentives for undergraduates to consider the volunteer service 
agency still he acknowledged the irony of a military school 
preparing people for the peace corps 
the impetus came from university president w russell todd a 
retired general with 32 years of army service including combat duty 
in vietnam todd his son and his father are all graduates of 
norwich 
the most exciting thing about it is the way people perceive 
norwich university said todd theyve seen us as a bunch of 
rambos and when weve expressed our mission in terms of the peace 
corps weve had a very very positive reaction from some people 
norwich university consists of two campuses and two student 
bodies one military and one civilian the peace corps program has 
drawn students from each 
the military college was founded in 1819 and the murals and 
plaques on its walls attest to its heroes from the mexican war of 
1847 to vietnam 
the civilian campus vermont college eight miles away in 
montpelier was founded in 1834 as a methodist seminary 
it was merged into norwich university in 1972 to allow a wider 
variety of programs and more opportunities for expansion the 
military college has an enrollment of 1300 cadets including 81 
women while the civilian college has 900 students 
todd said he had been looking for a way to give the civilian 
part of the student body the sense of national service and when 
his wife caroline came back from a conference on volunteerism 
last summer she told him i found what weve been looking for 
she had heard loret miller ruppe director of the peace corps 
report on a proposal by rev theodore m hesburgh president 
emeritus of the university of notre dame that the federal 
government devise an rotclike peace corps preparation program that 
colleges could incorporate 
so rather than wait for the federal government to devise a 
program we decided wed experiment said todd when i 
discussed it with the peace corps they were fascinated 
but what surprised todd was that the peace corps was not nearly 
as interested as he was in putting the program on the civilian 
campus instead they wanted it on the military campus because of 
the cadet corps physical and leadership training a compromise was 
struck to make it available to students on both campuses 
only four students are enrolled in the first class three of 
whom had been in rotc on the military campus and one from the 
civilian campus todd who attributed the low enrollment to the 
programs newness last fall said the goal is 60 students two years 
from now 
the four students now enrolled are not sure whether they will go 
into the peace corps students are not committed to entering once 
they graduate nor is the peace corps under obligation to accept 
them 
as an incentive norwich is offering low interest loans of up to 
5000 to students in their senior year then writing them off if 
they complete two years service in the peace corps 
military students at norwich must take four years of rotc but 
service after graduation is optional if they agree to accept a 
commission for active service after graduation they are paid 100 
a month in their last two years of college otherwise they receive 
no monthly stipend while in school and go into the reserves upon 
graduation 
tuition fees and room and board run 12500 a year at norwich 
miss klejnot a 21yearold junior biology major from portland 
maine initially enrolled in air force rotc because she wanted to 
see what the military was like but after 2 years she decided she 
didnt want to devote her future to a regulated life in the 
military 
the peace corps option was available so i decided to see what 
it was like she said 
even though she dropped rotc she still has to wear her uniform 
and attend three formations a day a requirement for all cadets on 
the military campus 
the peace corps program was designed by richard may the 
director and university chaplain and a committee of faculty 
members who had worked with the peace corps and other volunteer 
agencies in third world countries may himself had worked with 
cambodian refugees while serving as a navy line officer in vietnam 
he also went to the agencies themselves to find out why their 
volunteers did or did not complete their tours the peace corps has 
a dropout rate of about 30 percent may said he found that many 
volunteers have little community service experience and are 
frustrated once they arrive overseas 
the norwich program includes three hours of work in the 
community once a week classroom studies of the third world and a 
summer internship between the junior and senior years in jamaica 
working in the slums of kingston 
the whole emphasis in the military is to keep from going to 
war by strength said todd the other half of the equation is 
to make friends and make the world a better place and you wont 
have to go to war either

portauprince haiti ap the 7000member military long a 
dominant force in haiti would be put to work building bridges and 
promoting public health under a reorganization plan drawn up by the 
nations new leader 
the plan a key part of the 86page platform of president leslie 
manigats national democratic progressive rally also would 
separate the police from the armed forces and put them under 
civilian control 
there is a perception the army was corrupted by the 
duvalier dictatorship the party document says but there is 
another truth also incontestable that the army was the victim of 
the duvalier dictatorship which humiliated dismantled and 
decapitated it 
there must be a rehabilitation to wipe out the image that 
the army is a repressive force against the civilian population 
manigat as a candidate and now president has acted as a buffer 
between the army and its harshest critics he claims he can control 
the institution that has dominated politics in this impoverished 
caribbean country of 6 million people from the time haiti won 
independence from france in 1804 
following the end of the 19year us occupation in 1934 the 
army put dumarsais estime in as president in 1946 took power 
itself in 1950 under col paul magloire and helped francois papa 
doc duvalier win a disputed election that began a brutal 29year 
dictatorship in 1957 
duvalier set up the tonton macoutes militia which came to be 
generally regarded as street thugs when the army and coast guard 
plotted against him he emasculated haitis armed forces by 
shuffling retiring and sometimes executing commanders he based 
promotions on loyalty to him and gave away state monopolies to his 
military favorites 
when duvaliers son and successor jeanclaude baby doc 
duvalier fled into exile in february 1986 a militarydominated 
junta led by lt gen henri namphy then the armys chief of staff 
took control and ruled by decree for two years leading up to 
manigats election jan 17 and inauguration feb 7 
opposition leaders say it remains to be seen whether the army 
will return to the barracks as namphy now the commander in chief 
had pledged before the election and whether manigat has the power 
to reorganize or dismantle an entrenched military hierarchy 
a western diplomat who closely tracks political and military 
developments here said in an interview all those who made 
officer between 1959 and 1971 were duvalier appointees of very low 
quality the officers who graduated in 1973 two years after 
baby doc reopened the haitian military academy see things 
differently theyre more progressive theyre more educated 
theyre more professional 
but theyre blocked by the system theyre blocked by the 
duvalier appointees above them the colonels the generals who 
are not leaving said the diplomat speaking only on condition of 
anonymity 
the military also has been linked to drug trafficking and to the 
smuggling of cars rice sugar and other goods 
the us drug enforcement administration opened an office in 
portauprince in november because cocaine smuggling was rising so 
rapidly in haiti a dea informant osvaldo quintana testified in 
federal court in miami fla in january that the trafficking was 
taking place under the protection of haitian soldiers 
armed forces of haiti officials rarely respond to such criticism 
or charges the military is a closed secretive organization 
all interviews have to be cleared with brig gen carl michel 
nicolas who is namphys successor as chief of staff nicolas did 
not respond to a written request for an interview with the 
associated press 
the presentday army structure was established by us marines 
in 1916 to help put down a guerrillastyle insurrection it is the 
main component of the armed forces which also include the police 
coast guard fire department a presidential guard and several 
other battalions and departmental commands 
the armed forces main role is to protect the president and 
maintain security a difficult task given their small numbers and 
inadequate equipment and training the fire department is 
notoriously slow and residents who have been robbed have to send 
their own cars to pick up police investigators 
military recruits drawn from the lower middle class are paid 
the equivalent of 160 a month on a pay scale that ranges up to 
1800 for colonels and 3400 for namphy the top commander 
enlistment terms run for six years and the military is 
considered a good career in a country where more than half the 
population cannot find steady work and the annual per capita income 
is about 350 
training is limited and equipment consists mostly of aging 
handmedowns from the united states m1 rifles and m14 
automatic weapons a halfdozen helicopters of which only two or 
three work a few armored personnel carriers and some cutters that 
patrol the coast 
for 7000 men fewer than a single us army division there are 
five generals and 24 colonels 
while namphy is the commander in chief the 500man battalion at 
the dessalines barracks acts semiautonomously under col 
jeanclaude paul 
on feb 15 in miami osvaldo quintana the dea informant linked 
paul to drug trafficking the 35yearold miami businessman told a 
news conference that he personally arranged a 100kilogram 
220pound cocaine shipment in december 1986 quintana said we 
flew the shipment out of his own personal ranch in haiti 
quintanas lawyer in miami ellis rubin said he was trying to 
arrange for quintana to testify before the us senate committee 
that is investigating alleged drug smuggling by gen manuel antonio 
noriega the panamanian military strongman 
the dessalines battalion was involved in almost every incident 
last summer when soldiers shot and killed unarmed antigovernment 
demonstators 
the greenuniformed blackbooted battalion which patrols 
streets in this sprawling capital of 1 million was noticeably 
absent nov 29 however when gunmen with hand grenades and 
automatic weapons killed at least 34 people and forced the 
cancellation of what would have been haitis first free open and 
independently run presidential election in 30 years 
it is the only unit that is really feared here the western 
diplomat said noting that some of the duvaliers tonton macoutes 
were incorporated into it the men are very loyal to col paul 
he ignores the chain of command and commands them directly 
nevertheless the diplomat said he was optimistic that manigat 
might succeed in his efforts to educate and modernize the armed 
forces and reorient soldiers to accept civilian rule and 
participate in national development 
the young officers aspire for change and they see it coming 
the diplomat said the problem remaining is the dessalines 
barracks were waiting to see what manigat will do about that 
in the next five years well see a new generation of officers 
with diplomas who have traveled abroad who are of a different 
mentality who are young and cultured they can give a new image to 
the army 
a leading haitian academic who has had a 30year acquaintance 
with manigat said he is not sure that will happen 
speaking only on the condition that he remain anonymous fearing 
recrimination he said the army wants to leave the civilian 
structures of power not power itself theres too much money to be 
made 
manigat is no puppet far from it it is an extremely 
interesting battle he makes the army believe he supports it the 
army makes him believe they support him each one knows the other 
is lying 
in the final analysis manigat is not capable of dominating 
the army or manipulating power haitis immediate future is going 
to be as tragic as its present and its past i fear uprisings among 
the people

as lawyers for three tobacco companies and a 
man suing them for his wifes cancer death do battle inside a 
federal courtroom another struggle goes on outside this one waged 
by a squad of public relations people 
at each break in the proceedings pr specialists for the 
companies buttonhole reporters covering the trial drop by the 
courthouse press room to say hello and make sure no questions 
need to be answered and happily provide transcripts of testimony 
favorable to their side with key passages highlighted 
the 22 billionayear tobacco industry has never shrunk from 
getting its message across but some observers say this trial 
involving liggett group inc philip morris co and lorillard inc 
presents an especially striking image problem 
lawyers for the man suing the three companies have spent 4 
years gathering an unprecedented quantity of confidential internal 
corporate documents and interviewing key company officials 
in the first two weeks of the trial for example jurors have 
seen notes by a liggett vice president saying that selling a safer 
cigarette would increase the risk of cancer lawsuits involving 
existing products 
a memo describing a meeting of liggett officials and consultants 
says the company wanted to sell cigarettes so we must get over 
the hurdle of linking smoking and lung cancer 
last thursday the jury heard testimony from an assistant 
research director of liggett saying that the company blocked 
publication of research on a safer cigarette and his participation 
in a scientific conference 
the trial is likely to last two to four months 
the documents and testimony were introduced to bolster antonio 
cipollones contention that liggett philip morris and lorillard 
were responsible for the lungcancer death of his wife rose a 
40year smoker 
cipollone charges in part that the companies failed to do enough 
research on the health effects of smoking to disclose adequately 
what research they did or to put a safer cigarette on the market 
cipollone doesnt have a pr staff but his two lawyers and their 
courtroom staff of three dont stint on meeting the needs of 
reporters they readily present their interpretation of the days 
evidence during courtroom breaks and make available copies of 
documents deemed newsworthy as soon as us district judge h lee 
sarokin enters them into evidence 
does the trial truly present an image problem for the industry 
no i dont think so said john scanlon one of five pr 
professionals working on behalf of the tobacco companies they 
attend court nearly every day and work out of an office rented in 
downtown newark 
a lawyer from the prominent kansas city firm of shook hardy amp 
bacon is also on hand to answer all legal questions from reporters 
inside the courtroom a team of nine attorneys handles the defense 
our purpose here is just to keep things as clean as possible 
in terms of trying to keep the story straight said scanlon the 
52yearold senior vice president of the international pr firm 
daniel j edelman inc 
scanlon has made his mark in the field in recent years by 
presenting litigants positions from courthouse steps while lawyers 
handle the juries inside 
the bearded straighttalking member of former new york city 
mayor john lindsays administration handled the media in highly 
publicized libel trials for cbs the boston globe and mcclatchy 
newspapers 
our role is to present a balanced objective picture of 
whats going on said scanlon colleague alan hilburg who has his 
own pr firm in dallas and a joint venture in new york 
so many people enter with an anticigarette bias he said 
hilburg represented pennzoil co in its legal battle with energy 
giant texaco inc and worked on johnson amp johnsons campaign to 
recover from the devastation of the tylenoltampering incidents 
image could have an impact on wall street some analysts have 
said a legal loss in the suit which would be the industrys first 
in such a case could lower the value of tobacco company stocks 
however said analyst neal kaplan of interstate securities corp 
in charlotte nc its hard to picture the tobacco companies 
image as suffering because i dont think they have good images

gaf corps decision to exempt itself from 
delawares new antitakeover law reflects its own acquisitive 
philosophy rather than a groundswell of corporate opposition to the 
statute experts say 
gaf said tuesday its board of directors voted to opt out of 
takeover protections included in the controversial law making it 
the first major corporation to do so since the law took effect 
earlier this month 
the company is considering a 12 billion buyout offer from a 
group led by chairman samuel j heyman who has steered the 
chemical and building materials company through two major takeover 
battles as part of its acquisitive corporate strategy 
in proposing a buyout last september heyman said the move would 
allow gaf to pursue its takeover strategy without having to worry 
about the shortterm earnings pressures faced by many publiclyheld 
companies 
the managementled group has offered 40 in cash and 850 worth 
of debt securities for each of gafs roughly 277 million common 
shares outstanding heyman who also is gafs chief executive 
controls about 10 percent of the outstanding shares 
gaf stock rose 50 cents to close at 4762 a share tuesday on 
the new york stock exchange 
the company is based in wayne nj but is incorporated in 
delaware as are more than half of the fortune 500 companies 
a key provision of the new delaware law would bar a potential 
buyer from acquiring a company for three years after the buyer 
accumulated more than 15 percent of the target companys stock the 
provision would not apply if the buyer acquired a total of 85 
percent of the companys shares in the same transaction that it 
passed the 15 percent threshold or if the board of directors 
approved the takeover 
the provision was aimed at bustup deals where a hostile 
buyer sells off chunks of a target company in order to help finance 
the buyout and partial offers where the buyer acquires just enough 
shares to win control of the target and offers the remaining 
shareholders a lesser price for their stock 
statechartered companies have 90 days from the laws effective 
date to exempt themselves from the law after the 90day period a 
corporation may exempt itself only by a shareholders vote 
campeau corp and black amp decker corp which have made pending 
hostile buyout offers for delawareincorporated companies have 
filed lawsuits challenging the new law as unconstitutional 
in announcing the gaf boards action heyman criticized the law 
as an example of the proliferation of state antitakeover laws 
which he said helped entrench managements at the expense of 
shareholders 
this is an expression of our companys corporate governance 
philosophy heyman said in a telephone interview and we simply 
wanted to lend support to the effort in congress for federal 
preemption of state antitakeover laws 
gaf also released a letter from heyman urging david s ruder 
chairman of the federal securities and exchange commission to 
press congress to preempt antitakeover legislation in the states 
the gaf management groups buyout bid is unlikely to turn 
hostile but the delaware law could impede heymans takeover 
strategy by putting restraints on gaf attempts to acquire other 
companies 
last year gaf made an unsuccessful hostile bid for borgwarner 
corp which eventually agreed to a buyout by a group led by the 
investment firm merrill lynch amp co 
in late 1985 gaf made an unsuccessful but highly profitable 
attempt to take over union carbide corp gaf withdrew after union 
carbide undertook a major defensive restructuring but made about 
250 million in profit by selling the carbide stock it had 
accumulated 
gafs decision to exempt itself probably does not signal a trend 
among delawareincorporated companies experts said 
many of the thousands of major companies incorporated in 
delaware pushed for approval of the law and are deemed unlikely to 
forego its protection

burger king corp hopes to reignite sales growth 
with an advertising campaign that invokes the memory of the 
flamebroilingversusfrying debate that engulfed the fastfood 
industry in the early 1980s 
the campaign employs the theme we do it like youd do it and 
pitches burger kings flamebroiling process as the one which 
burgerlovers prefer 
the campaign contains some reminders of the hardhitting ads of 
1982 in which burger king asserted that tests showed people 
preferred its flamebroiled hamburgers to those from the industry 
leader mcdonalds corp 
mcdonalds objected saying its burgers are grilled and not 
fried the exchange became known as the burger wars 
mcdonalds name is only mentioned once in the new burger king 
ads which were previewed for the media tuesday in a new york hotel 
room decorated to look like a backyard complete with sod a 
barbecue pit lawnmower and picnic tables 
in one new ad a kindergartener discovers that her burger king 
hamburger has lines from broiling she likes the taste and asks 
a friend why she never gets similar lines on burgers from 
mcdonalds her pal shrugs 
in another ad a foreign exchange student savors a broiled 
burger king hamburger and complains to some friends that 
hamburgers are usually fried in his country when told that some 
burger places fry them here too the student registers his 
disbelief with a long noooooo 
the ads begin appearing feb 29 and burger king reportedly 
plans to spend about 200 million putting them on the air and in 
print over the next year 
the approach created by the agency nw ayer inc replaces the 
best food for fast times theme that had been created by j 
walter thompson ayer was selected for the burger king account last 
fall 
burger king officials speaking on condition they not be 
identified by name said consumers liked the best food and 
this is a burger king town campaigns created by thompson but 
failed to remember the characteristic that separates burger king 
from other hamburger chains flamebroiling 
charles s olcott president of the miamibased burger king usa 
said the companys average sales per store had stalled burger 
kings average sales per store cracked 1 million for the first 
time in 1985 but rose to only 102 million in the year ended may 
31 1987 
mcdonalds had average sales per store of 137 million in 1986 
and has about 7400 stores nationwide compared with 4700 for 
burger king 
they are the leaders in the fastfood market which the trade 
magazine advertising age estimates at 60 billion hamburgers 
account for roughly half of the figure 
another hamburger chain wendys international inc based in 
dublin ohio recently began airing new versions of an old campaign 
wendys and hardees food systems inc based in rocky mount 
nc are fighting for third place in hamburgers analysts say 
the agency backer spielvogel bates has created some new 
versions of a 2yearold campaign for wendys known as 
hamburger ahamburger b 
the campaign spoofs consumer tastetests as an interviewer asks 
someone in each ad to choose between a freshlooking wendys 
hamburger a and an unappetizing hamburger b 
a truck driver picks b in one ad and beams that he can have one 
in shakeytown and still be tasting it in salt lake in another 
a woman trying to lose weight said shed pick b because she 
wouldnt be tempted to eat it 
wendys used humor to boost sales in 1984 when its advertising 
asked wheres the beef wendys average sales per store peaked

a proposed merger of the tiremaking divisions of 
firestone tire amp rubber co and tokyobased bridgestone corp would 
give a japanese company control of the worlds thirdlargest tire 
company experts say 
firestone which was fifth in worldwide tire sales in 1986 
announced the plan to merge its tire business with no 3 
bridgestone on tuesday 
based on 1986 tire sales figures the most recent available 
of 23 billion for firestone and about 31 billion for 
bridgestone the proposed firestone tire co would rank third 
behind goodyear tire amp rubber co of the united states and michelin 
of france 
more important the joint venture with majority ownership by 
bridgestone would give the japanese company a share of the us 
originalequipment tire market said ed noga editor of the 
industry trade journal rubber amp plastics news 
bridgestone is an aggressive company that wants to grow in the 
united states and they wanted to get access to the 
originalequipment market noga said in a telephone interview 
from akron ohio where firestones tire division is based 
chicagobased firestone has been successful in obtaining 
originalequipment contracts meaning it supplies tires to car and 
truck manufacturers to be used on new vehicles 
firestone made the surprise announcement of an agreement in 
principle with bridgestone and said it would enter into formal 
negotiations immediately to reach a final agreement 
firestone stock soared 925 to 45 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading tuesday following the disclosure 
the announcement came amid speculation that firestone would sell 
its tire division to the italian tire manufacturer pirelli spa 
bridgestone would own about 75 percent of the company and 
firestone 25 percent 
the two companies plan to operate the joint venture doing 
business worldwide as firestone tire co as a relatively 
autonomous business unit subject to the direction and control of a 
board of directors consisting of persons representing the owners 
the statement said 
under the tentative agreement the joint venture would be 
initially financed with 750 million in equity from bridgestone 
250 million from firestone and 500 million in debt 
the agreement also calls for firestone to transfer tire assets 
and liabilities with an equity value of about 15 billion to the 
joint venture 
after spinning off the tire business firestone would still 
retain its 1500 carcare centers firestone diversified products 
which includes divisions that manufacture industrial and building 
products firestone synthetic rubber and latex co which 
manufactures synthetic rubber and operates a rubber plantation in 
liberia and firestone car rental inc 
the firestone tire division employs 30000 people worldwide 
said spokesman robert troyer the rest of firestones businesses 
employ 23500 he said 
the creation of the joint venture is expected to generate more 
than 1 billion in cash for the parent firestone tire amp rubber co 
the company said 
once final agreement with bridgestone is reached firestone 
would schedule a special shareholders meeting to seek approval of 
the joint venture 
the company also would ask shareholders to approve a financial 
restructuring that would distribute a very substantial portion of 
the cash generated by the transaction to firestone shareholders 
the statement said 
the joint ventures headquarters would be located in akron and 
would be assigned the exclusive right to use firestones name on 
tires throughout the world 
in a related move tuesday firestones board adopted a poison 
pill antitakeover plan to guard against unfriendly suitors 
the plan would take effect if any person or group buys 20 
percent or more of firestones common stock without the approval of 
the companys board of directors the firestone statement said the 
antitakeover plan was intended both to ensure that firestones 
shareholders will retain the benefits of a joint venture with 
bridgestone and to protect the full value of its shareholders 
investment in the company 
firestone is the thirdlargest usbased tire manufacturer 
behind goodyear and bf goodrich co 
bridgestone held a 2 percent share of the us replacement 
passenger tire market last year and had a 7 percent share of the 
us replacement truck tire market according to modern tire 
journal an industry publication 
bridgestone is in the process of moving its bridgestone usa 
tire inc headquarters from torrance calif to lavergne tenn 
where it operates its sole us manufacturing plant a trucktire 
factory said greg smith publisher of modern tire journal 
firestone put its tire division in a freestanding position last 
november when the top headquarters staff relocated from akron to 
chicago and the company will seek shareholder approval next month 
to change the name of the company to firestone inc

rep thomas luken dohio wants the federal 
trade commission to explain why it decided not to pursue an 
indepth review of an attempted takeover of cincinnatibased 
federated department stores inc 
luken chairman of the house energy and commerce transportation 
subcommittee has scheduled a hearing on the matter for today 
the commissioners of the ftc were scheduled to testify as was 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio chairman of the senate judiciary 
antitrust subcommittee metzenbaum has said the takeover raises the 
possibility of reduced competition in several cities higher 
prices less consumer choice and a substantial loss of jobs 
luken said tuesday that documents suggest the ftc based its 
decision on state and regional impact rather than on individual 
metropolitan areas 
he said that according to an ftc memorandum the agencys staff 
recommended against seeking additional information on the proposed 
merger between federated and campeau corp of toronto on the basis 
of the competitive situations in florida and new england as a whole 
in other cases of department store mergers luken said the ftc 
has used individual metropolitan areas to gauge potential 
anticompetitive effects 
theyve used a totally false basis for denying the heart of 
competition he said 
ftc spokeswoman susan tichnor said the agency declined comment 
federated operates about 650 retail stores in 36 states and had 
sales exceeding 11 billion in 1987 
its holdings include the new yorkbased chains of bloomingdales 
and abraham and straus lazarus in cincinnati filenes of boston 
burdines of miami richs in atlanta bullocks and bullocks 
wilshire in los angeles and i magnin in san francisco 
campeau a retailing and real estate development company on 
tuesday sweetened its bid for federated to 66 a share or about 
585 billion in cash but federated rejected it saying campeau 
lacked adequate financing for the takeover 
according to the ftc memo of particular competitive concern 
were federated stores in new england and florida that compete with 
campeaus jordan marsh stores 
however the ftc said that based on 1982 figures campeau held 
only 15 percent of the new england department store market compared 
with 77 percent for federated in florida each company held 164 
percent of the market the ftc said 
although this acquisition would combine the first and 
thirdlargest department store chains in the country we do not 
feel that it raises competitive concerns the memo concluded 
campeau bought allied stores in december 1986 then sold several 
divisions of the company however it retained several retailing 
chains including ann taylor brooks brothers and jordan marsh 
ohio politicians are worried that campeau will buy federated 
sell major portions of the company and fire or lay off large 
numbers of its employees federated operates 63 stores in ohio 
employing about 16000 workers in the state 
federated has spurned campeau three times federated rejected 
campeaus initial 47ashare 42 billion takeover offer as 
inadequate 
it later turned down an improved 61ashare 54 billion bid 
as well as tuesdays increased offer because it was not convinced 
campeau had the necessary financing

an offer by olympia amp york developments ltd to 
increase its stake in santa fe southern pacific corp is a shrewd 
move intended to put the canadian companys imprint on any 
restructuring plans analysts say 
the torontobased real estate company which seeks to increase 
its interest in santa fe from 105 percent to 199 percent 
launched a 245 million offer tuesday for up to 14 million shares 
the olympia amp york offer which expires at midnight march 13 
hinges on payment by santa fe of a special dividend the cash 
portion was paid tuesday and the debenture payment is set for 
march 1 
the olympia amp york offer amounts to 1750 per share it is 
challenging a plan by henley group inc of la jolla calif to 
wage a proxy fight for control of santa fe 
i think olympia amp york are trying to make sure they have a 
controlling position in the company said isabel benham an 
analyst at printon kane in new york i think its a smart move 
henley group is santa fes largest shareholder with 157 
percent it plans to wage a proxy fight in opposition to santa fes 
proposed 47 billion restructuring plan which is seen as an 
effort to stop henleys advances 
olympia amp york supported the restructuring and its 
representatives have been nominated to two seats on the santa fe 
board 
santa fe which has about 1562 million shares outstanding said 
it had been informed of olympia amp yorks tender offer but had no 
comment spokesman richard hall said 
norm ritter a spokesman for henley group said company chairman 
michael dingman was pleased with the move but he would not 
elaborate 
under the santa fe restructuring plan shareholders would 
receive 25 in cash and 5 in subordinated debentures per share 
henley has said the debentures are another effort by santa fe to 
prevent a takeover and is challenging them in court ritter said a 
delaware chancery court has set feb 26 as the date for a 
preliminary hearing on the issue 
a debenture is a debt repayable within a specified time and 
bearing a fixed rate of interest which must be paid whether or not 
the company issuing it makes a profit 
meanwhile moodys investors service inc citing the effects of 
the restructuring plan said it downgraded the securities ratings 
of santa fe and its subsidiaries the atchison topeka and santa fe 
railway and southern pacific co 
moodys said the downgrade was based on the substantial 
weakening in the parents debtprotection measurements because of a 
recent corporate restructuring 
about 14 billion of securities are affected

the maker of playtex tampons analysts say 
on tuesday johnson amp johnson said it has agreed to pay 726 
million for the playtex holding co division that makes the tampons

in the united states and playtex said in a joint announcement that 
the transaction is still subject to government approval

million on sales of 300 million 
analyst lucy olwell of merrill lynch in new york estimated sales 
from playtex tampons at 125 million or about 25 percent of the 
more than 500 million domestic tampon market and sales from the 
other family products lines at about 100 million 
tambrands tampex line is the market leader with 55 percent she

a company accused along with the hunt brothers of 
cornering the silver market in 1980 agreed to pay a peruvian 
company 365 million in an outofcourt settlement a minpeco sa 
attorney said 
aml futures is the last of six financial institutions accused by 
minpeco of participating in an illegal price manipulation scheme 
that drove up silver prices that led to substantial losses for the 
company owned by the government of peru 
the hunts claim they did nothing illegal when they began pouring 
money into the silver market from august 1979 to march 1980 the 
price of silver rose from 9 an ounce to 50 an ounce before the 
market collapsed to about 10 an ounce 
jury selection is scheduled to begin thursday in the trial 
against the hunts nelson bunker william herbert and lamar 
before us federal district judge morris e lasker in new york 
city opening arguments in the case are scheduled for wednesday 
feb 24 
the aml futures settlement and those by the other institutions 
add up to 6465 million said mark a cymrot of cole amp corrette 
the washington dc firm that represents minpeco 
minpeco perus largest precious metals distributor seeks to 
recover 150 million in damages

that minpeco said it lost in trading losses and potential profits 
because of silver market manipulations in late 1979 and early 1980 
by the hunt brothers 
on dec 22 lasker ruled that minpeco must subtract from its 
damage claim profits made when silver bullion prices skyrocketed 
and could not sue for lost potential profits these rulings reduced 
the amount of the claim to 150 million 
the hunts also are facing two class action suits by more than 
17000 silver futures investors who claim that illegal market

chrysler corp said it has raised prices on its 
imported mitsubishi motors corp cars an average 46 percent over 
comparably equipped 1987 models 
the new prices announced tuesday also were higher in most 
cases than tentative prices used since the model year began in 
october said chrysler spokeswoman karen stewart 
the increases followed a debate between chrysler and various 
japanese automakers in which chrysler charged the japanese 
companies may be dumping cars and trucks on the us market 
dumping is selling foreign products here for less than in their 
home market 
chrysler has maintained the japanese companies probably havent 
increased prices enough to reflect the dramatic jump in the value 
of the japanese yen against the dollar in the past two years 
the dumping debate heated up at news conferences preceding last 
weekends opening of the chicago auto show where chrysler also 
introduced a new japanese car the mitsubishibuilt eagle summit 
for its jeepeagle lineup 
toyota motor sales usa vice president robert mccurry charged 
that if the japanese were dumping so were the us automakers who 
sell imported japanese cars under their own nameplates 
of the big three us automakers chrysler is the most dependent 
on japanese imports about 11 percent of its cars and 40 percent of 
its light trucks are built by mitsubishi in japan 
mccurry also said chrysler ford motor co and general motors 
corp were charging less for imported japanese cars sold under 
american nameplates than were japanese companies who made the cars 
at the prices announced tuesday a base plymouth colt twodoor 
hatchback will start at 5998 down from 6005 for a comparable 
1987 model and up from the tentative 1988 price of 5899 
at the other extreme the base price on the sporty chrysler 
conquest tsi coupe rose to 18683 from 18005 on a comparable 
1987 model and up from the tentative 1988 price of 18155 stewart 
said 
chris cedergren industry analyst with jd power and associates 
in agoura calif said japanese automakers have held down prices 
on their entrylevel cars and made up the difference on 
higherpriced models 
automakers value entrylevel buyers because of the chance they 
will become loyal customers and buy more expensive cars from the 
same company later

chrysler corp chariman lee iacocca says his 
company will establish an estimated 20 million trust fund to help 
the 5500 autoworkers at its kenosha plant meet housing education 
and other needs after they lose their jobs when the factory closes 
gov tommy g thompson who has threatened to sue chrysler over 
the plant closing called the announcement a good first step 
but that the automaker must do more to avoid the possibility of 
ending up in court 
leaders and members of united autoworkers union local 72 which 
represents 5000 hourly workers at kenosha were less enthusiastic 
about 80 union members set up a picket line outside the hotel 
where iacocca held a news conference to announce the trust fund 
the money for which would come from chryslers profits on all its 
cars sold in wisconsin this year 
iacocca said based on 1987 sales the chryslerkenosha trust 
fund should grow to about 20 million by the end of the year it 
would be administered by a sevenmember board of trustees appointed 
by state and local officials and by chrysler and its dealer 
organizations 
we are not interested in a charity program that is financed 
only if chrysler cars are sold said rudy kuzel bargaining 
chairman for local 72 we want jobs he could have said i will 
keep my word and keep the plant open 
kuzel also said the offer of a 20 million trust fund was too 
little 
our attorneys tell us the damages in this case are 1 
billion kuzel said adding that figure includes the plants 
total payroll for five years 
but leaders of the national uaw were warmer in their reaction 
chrysler should be commended for showing a degree of 
responsiveness in this painful situation the uaw said in a 
statement released in detroit 
iacocca said the trust fund would be in addition to 
approximately 13 million that the company will give governments 
to repay for capital improvements such as roads it would also be 
in addition to benefits guaranteed workers in the contract between 
chrysler and the uaw and benefits negotiated by the union in a 
plant closing agreement iacocca said 
iacocca stressed however there was no way he would change his 
mind about closing the kenosha carmaking plant which is scheduled 
to shut down this summer chrysler will still employ about 1000 
people in kenosha at an engine plant 
the decision to close kenosha was a crummy call but one we had 
to make time and the marketplace just caught up with an 86year 
old plant iacocca said 
iacocca also said the companys decision to close the plant did 
not break any contracts with the state regarding the future of the 
former american motors corp facility 
we are guilty as hell of being cockeyed optimists and we are 
paying the price for the optimism right now iacocca said 
iacocca said the company had hoped to continue building cars in 
kenosha for threetofive years but car sales were not good enough 
to allow that 
what we did unintentionally was to create expectations that 
couldnt be fulfilled iacocca said 
iacocca said the decision to establish the trust fund should not 
be viewed as a precedent for other auto plant closings 
he said kenosha was a unique situation because of the impact the 
closing will have on a relatively small city kenoshas population 
is about 75000 
iacocca also said thompsons threats to file a lawsuit against 
the nations third largest automaker were not a factor in setting 
up the trust fund 
iacocca said he thompson and house armed services committee 
chairman les aspin dwis would meet in washington on thursday 
he said he hoped an agreement would be reached eventually that 
would avoid the need for the state and chrysler to meet in the 
courtroom

acting premier li peng said wednesday the 
government may expand its subsidies of major commodities to cut the 
inflation rate which hit 75 percent last year 
in a speech marking the lunar new year li told a crowd of about 
6000 at the great hall of the people that the rapid rise in 
prices especially for food was chinas most pressing economic 
problem the official xinhua news agency reported 
xinhua said li admonished governments at all levels to make 
price stability a priority and said the state council chinas 
cabinet is considering ways of expanding the subsidy program 
however we should not follow the road as we did in the past 
where prices were rigidly controlled by administrative means li 
added 
li did not specify which price subsidies would be increased or 
by how much or whether price supports would be introduced for 
nonsubsidized items 
any such move would be a dramatic step away from the 
governments goal of gradually ending price controls and letting 
market forces take over 
subsidies for nonstaple foods including vegetables have been 
gradually lifted in the past few years and the government has 
reduced the proportion of grain and other staples sold at 
subsidized prices 
the subsidies are believed to be a major contributor to the 
government deficit which rose 14 percent in 1987 to 8 billion 
yuan or 21 billion

economic growth in the 12nation 
european economic community will drop below 2 percent this year and 
in 1989 as a result of the stock market crisis last fall a report 
released thursday said 
but the report by the eec executive commission predicted there 
would be no economic recession 
the commission said that the turmoil on the worlds financial 
markets late last year has increased the uncertainties in the 
world economy and upset earlier economic predictions for a 25 
percent average growth in the common market 
eec economists said this level of growth is too low to bring 
about a reduction in the rate of unemployment which currently 
stands at 115 percent 
peter schmidhuber the eec commissioner for economic affairs 
told a news conference the analysis was based on the assumption the 
us dollar will stay stable at 160 german marks and 125 yen 
through the next two years 
changes on the financial markets would have profound 
implications for the european economies and could offset any 
national efforts to stimulate growth schmidhuber said 
the commission said the slow growth will be caused largely by a 
decline in the growth of domestic demand and sluggish industrial 
investments 
exports the commission said will remain flat in 1988 while 
imports will increase by about 7 percent inflation although up 
against 1987 will remain between 3 percent and 5 percent 
according to the report virtually all eec countries will 
experience a decline in economic growth compared with 1987 
the report said the eec should contribute to economic growth of 
its member states by stimulating cooperation in research and 
development investing in large infrastructure products and 
improving the regulatory climate

treasury bond futures contracts then turned the trading cards over 
to a codefendant 
if the position turned out to be profitable the trades were 
cleared but if they turned out to be losers dewey and the others 
could walk away from the loss and it could not be traced according

housing construction fell 19 percent in 
january to its lowest level since the end of the last recession 
the government reported today 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were being 
built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 138 million units 
last month 
the january setback which followed a 155 percent plunge in 
december surprised analysts who had been forecasting a modest 
rebound in construction activity 
the housing sector is being watched closely at present since it 
is often one of the first sectors to turn down at the start of a 
new recession 
while the majority of economists believe the country will be 
able to escape a downturn in this presidential election year some 
forecasters dispute this outlook in part because of concern about 
the record collapse of stock prices last october 
the january annual starts level was the slowest pace since a 
rate of 130 million units in december 1982 just as the last 
recession was ending the january pace was almost 24 percent below 
the rate at the beginning of 1987 
the weakness last month came from a 29 percent decline in 
construction of singlefamily homes which fell to an annual rate 
of 101 million units 
this drop offset a 08 percent increase in construction of 
multifamily housing wich edged up to an annual rate of 366000 
units still 35 percent below the level of a year ago this sector 
has been in a slump because of the impact of the 1986 tax law 
which removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real 
estate 
in other ominous news permits considered a good sign of future 
activity fell an even sharper 82 percent in january to an annual 
rate of 125 million units the lowest level for permits since 
january 1985 permits had fallen 74 percent in december 
the january weakness in construction starts came from two 
sectors of the country starts fell 218 percent in the midwest to 
an annual rate of 223000 units and dropped 171 percent in the 
south to 469000 units 
these declines were partially offset by a 276 percent increase 
in starts in the northeast where homes were being built at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 291000 units and a 212 
percent increase in the west where starts rose to a rate of 
394000 units

the european commission said wednesday 
it was investigating allegations that seven japanese photocopier 
manufacturers were dumping their products or selling them for 
less than they do in their home market 
the commission also said it began an inquiry into whether south 
korean companies were dumping small color television sets in the 
european market 
the commission said the japanese companies canon konishiroku 
matsushita minolta ricoh sharp and toshiba were accused of 
making photocopiers in europe using mainly components from japan to 
get around a 20 percent antidumping duty on photocopier imports 
from japan 
the eec decided a year ago to impose the duties affecting the 
1 billion photocopier market eec companies account for only 15 
percent of the market 
the commission said that the latest complaint alleged that the 
japanese companies had started or increased production of 
photocopiers in europe when an initial antidumping inquiry started 
the complaint also charged that the value of the japanese 
components in the photocopiers exceeded by 50 percent the value of 
all the other components used to make the machines 
in the case involving south korea a group of european consumer 
electronics companies had complained that korean imports were 
increasing by more than 100 percent a year and that prices of the 
television sets were considerably lower than those charged by eec 
manufacturers 
the prices undercut eec producers by as much as 38 percent 
forcing eec manufacturers to cut prices according to the industry 
complaint 
eec producers were alleged to have lost 6 percent of the eec 
market as a result of the korean dumping at a time when consumption 
rose by 11 percent the domestic industry claimed

their federal tax returns continues to spread the federal 
government could feel the pinch right in the pocketbook 
lawrence b gibbs commissioner of the internal revenue service 
notes that five years ago 14 percent of all individual returns 
were filed in january and 34 percent in april but last year only 
4 percent were filed during the first month and almost 40 percent 
in april 
if this trend were exacerbated by tax reform the sweeping 
1986 law it could jam the system by slowing down processing and 
the issuance of refunds gibbs told a senate finance subcommittee 
tuesday as a result there could be a high price to pay 
if we dont process returns within a 45day period after the 
return due date the government must pay interest on refunds he 
noted that due date is april 15 
the irs is not ready to push the panic button even though 97 
percent fewer returns have been filed this year than during the 
same period in 1987 just a week ago that gap was 175 percent 
it does not appear that there is an easy solution to reversing 
the trend toward late filing gibbs said he cited surveys 
finding that the chief reasons for later filing include simply 
procrastinating and failure to receive some information necessary 
to prepare a return 
the irs is not sure how the new tax law with its lower rates 
reduced deductions and higher personal exemptions will affect the 
latefiling trend some returns are simpler under the new law 
others are more complicated 
the backlog of unprocessed returns at the irs was down to 115 
million last week compared with 129 million at this time last 
year the number of couples and individuals receiving refunds 17 
million also dropped from 19 million the average refund was up 
13 percent to 743 
by the end of the taxfiling season the irs expects that about 
80 percent of the 107 million returns will qualify for refunds 
but no one can say with a great degree of certainty because of 
the new tax law and the fact that most workers filed new 
taxwithholding forms with their employers last year 
gibbs said the irs is watching closely to determine whether a 
significant number of americans may have had too little tax 
withheld from paychecks last year an thus would owe the 
government when they file pockets of underwithholding among 
certain groups of taxpayers such as highincome taxpayers working 
couples and young wage earners could exist he said 
because of confusion about the new law and a complex w4 
withholding form the irs has agreed to waive underpayment 
penalties if too little was withheld from 1987 wages that amnesty 
does not apply for 1988 earnings 
despite more personnel more equipment and a desire to see that 
taxpayers get all the information and forms they need we are 
concerned that the complexity of the law and the volume of changes 
will provide us ample opportunities to make mistakes said robert 
lebaube director of taxpayer services 
sen david pryor dark chairman of the finance subcommittee 
offered some rare words of praise for the irs 
pryor after studying reports that found irs employees in the 
past sometephone questions from taxpayers decided to test the 
improvements that the irs has been bragging about last week he 
said he assigned eight members of his staff to call irs 
assistors around the nation with some questions 
not one staff member who discussed a particular problem 
encountered anyone on the other end of the line except a very 
courteous friendly irs employee who almost went overboard to 
help pryor said 
his staff is still checking the answers to the questions but 
one thing is sure pryor said it often took several tries to ring 
an irs number and not get a busy signal

us industrial output rose 02 percent while housing 
construction dropped by 19 percent in january the governemnt 
reported today 
the federal reserve said production at american factories mines 
and utilities increased for the fourth consecutive month despite 
a sharp drop in the production of autos following gains of 04 
percent in both november and december 
those gains helped push the production level up by 6 percent in 
the past 12 months providing further evidence of the strength in 
the manufacturing sector 
the weaker dollar has been a major benefit to us industry 
making american products competitive once more on overseas markets 
and boosting exports to record levels 
earlier the commerce department said januarys seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of housing construction stood at 138 million 
units a month the lowest level since the end of the last recession 
some analysts had expected a small rebound in the building of 
new homes and apartments following decembers 155 percent plunge 
in december 
they have been keeping a close eye on the housing sector since 
it is often one of the first sectors to turn down at the start of a 
new recession 
but the jury is still out on that question 
on tuesday federal reserve chairman alan greenspans remarks 
that the economy appears to be balanced riled the bond market but 
wall street ignored him and gave the dow jones industrial average 
its best showing in more than a month 
greenspans comments in a washington speech tuesday were 
interpreted by bond traders as a signal that the nations central 
bank wont move quickly to push interest rates down to stimulate 
the economy as had been widely expected he spoke against a 
background of government statistics that suggested the economy 
isnt slowing down despite the warning signs given by the stock 
crash four months ago on friday for example the government 
reported that the nations trade deficit shrank in december and 
inflation increased 
the 30year treasury bond the most closely watched issue fell 
about 10 per 1000 in face value after greenspan spoke though 
the price recovered somewhat later the bonds yield which moves 
inversely to price and can be a sensitive indicator of interest 
rates rose to 846 percent from 843 percent late friday 
on wall street investors largely overlooked greenspans remarks 
and the bond markets reaction buying stocks in a lateafternoon 
rally that baffled strategists because signs of higher interest 
rates usually depress stock prices 
the dow jones average rose 2271 points to 200597 its first 
finish above 2000 since jan 8 when computerized selling and a 
presidential panels report on the october stock crash sent the 
index down 14058 points to 191131 
the value of all us stocks rose 169 billion tuesday 
according to the wilshire associates 5000 equity index 
in other economic news tuesday a national real estate trade 
group said sales of existing homes steadied in 1987 at close to 4 
million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the stock market 
collapse 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes and condominiums totaled 3885 million units 
last year down 03 percent from the 1986 level of 3897 million 
units sales in both years were the fastest pace of this decade

campeau corp today boosted to 61 a share its 
tender offer for federated department store inc and promised to 
sweeten the offer again to 66 a share if federated agrees to be 
acquired by midnight sunday 
the move came a day after the giant retailers board rejected 
campeaus separate proposal to pay 66 a share or about 585 
billion for federated in a definitive merger agreement 
federateds board meeting in new york on tuesday instead 
approved a financial restructuring that could include the sale of 
most assets other than the companys department stores 
campeau sweetened its tender offer to 61 a share or about 54 
billion from the 47 a share roughly 42 billion it initially 
offered on jan 25 federated rejected the initial tender offer as 
inadequate 
federated stock fell 287 to 6087 a share in early new york 
stock exchange trading 
federated also has rejected campeaus alternative offer for a 
definitive merger agreement twice including the latest 66 
proposal and campeaus initial 61 a share offer because it was 
not convinced campeau had the necessary financing 
but campeau spokeswoman joele frank said in new york today that 
financing for a 66 bid is absolutely solid 
on tuesday campeau said youngstown ohio developer edward j 
debartolo agreed to increase his previously announced 400 million 
loan to 480 million to help support the buyout torontos 
reichmann family through its olympia amp york enterprises ltd has 
agreed to buy a 260 million interest in campeau corp campeau 
spokesmen said 
campeau said the bank of montreal and banque paribas of france 
had agreed to provide 200 million each in equity and to coax 
another 100 million in equity from other banks 
the developer reiterated today that first boston corp said in a 
letter it is highly confident it could provide up to 1 billion 
in bridge financing 
campeau said in a statement that it will increase its tender 
offer to 66 a share if federated enters into a definitive 
agreement to be acquired by midnight sunday 
the tender offer is conditioned upon certain recently enacted 
antitakeover legislation being invalidated or not applicable to 
the offer campeau said in a statement 
the developer is challenging a new antitakeover law in delaware 
as unconstitutional while federated is based in cincinnati it is 
incorporated in delaware 
federated said tuesday its bankers and financial advisers 
studied the latest bid and decided that campeau did not have the 
financing for such a transaction and that its ability to arrange 
financing continued to be questionable 
federated said its investment bankers believed the companys 
shareholders could be hurt if federated entered into an agreement 
with campeau and the transaction couldnt be completed at the 
specified price 
the federated board of directors then authorized negotiations 
with other unspecified parties that have shown an interest in 
buying federated or some of the companys assets 
the company said in a statement the board also considered a 
restructuring plan which would involve sales of most of 
federateds nondepartment store assets the possible issuance of 
preferred stock and either an extraordinary dividend or the 
repurchase of more than 50 percent of federateds outstanding stock 
the board requested that management proceed intensively with 
the further development of such a plan and authorized management 
to negotiate the terms of such preferred stock and to obtain prompt 
bids for all of federateds nondepartment store assets 
federateds directors said a shareholders rights plan adopted 
by the board last month would take effect thursday the plan known 
as a poison pill defense is designed to discourage an unwanted 
takeover by making such a move more expensive 
the company which operates about 650 stores in 36 states and 
had sales exceeding 11 billion in 1987 said nov 28 it had 885 
million shares outstanding 
federated said it spent the weekend negotiating with numerous 
parties including campeau which bought allied stores corp in 
december 1986 
among those believed to be interested is the takeover specialist 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co based in new york 
last week in a letter to henry kravis campeau chairman robert 
campeau warned that any agreement between kohlberg kravis and 
federated would be challenged in court 
after the allied purchase campeau sold several allied divisions 
but retained several retailing chains including ann taylor brooks 
brothers and jordan marsh 
federateds holdings include the new yorkbased bloomingdales 
and abraham and straus filenes of boston burdines of miami 
richs in atlanta bullocks and bullocks wilshire in los angeles 
i magnin in san francisco and lazarus in ohio

the obscure cargo airline that eastern 
airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces 
questions about its safety record as the government decides whether 
it is fit to carry passengers 
few air travelers have ever heard of orion air a north carolina 
cargo carrier which serves such air freight companies as united 
parcel service emery air freight and purolator 
but if labor strife intensifies at eastern many of that 
airlines customers may find themselves with tickets to fly orion 
and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up 
scrutiny of the airline 
recently eastern entered into an agreement with orion including 
the leasing of 26 of easterns jetliners that call on the airline 
to take over much of easterns routes if pilots and mechanics go on 
strike orion would fly the eastern planes with its own pilots and 
ground workers eastern officials said 
but the faa has yet to approve orion for passenger service and 
a senior agency official said tuesday that an enforcement 
proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against 
orion because of past safety violations 
an faa inspection report on orion shows a large number of 
serious safety infractions said anthony broderick the faas 
associate administrator for aviation standards 
broderick said the airlines management has taken actions to 
permit orion to safely operate its cargo business and training 
and maintenance procedures are being corrected to prevent similar 
occurrences in the future 
at congressional hearings tuesday james l heffernan an orion 
vice president said problems cited by the faa have been corrected 
heffernan called orions safety record excellent and maintained 
that much of the faas concerns stemmed from a misunderstanding 
by faa inspectors about orions method of record keeping 
orion air responded to each of the faas proposed findings 
last summer and are still in the process of resolving these issues 
obviously if any of the issues compromised air safety the faa 
would not have allowed orion air to continue to operate 
heffernan continued 
but rep cardiss collins dill chairman of the house 
government operations and transportation subcommittee called orion 
an airline in nearshambles and raised questions about its 
fitness to fly passengers 
in an interview steven kolski a vice president of eastern 
said eastern executives believe orions past safety problems have 
been resolved he expressed confidence that the airlines fitness 
will be assured before the faa allows it to engage in 
passengercarrying flights 
we got a report that said they orion are a hell of a lot 
better today than they were a year ago and that most if not all 
of their problems were behind them and they were in good shape 
said kolski 
kolski said eastern is relying on the agreement with orion to 
keep easterns service going if its 10000 mechanics go on strike 
and its 4000 pilots refuse to cross the picket lines 
but faa officials were not as certain that all of orions safety 
shortcomings are behind it the faa cited systemic difficulties 
with the airlines training program record keeping and use of 
operational handbooks that are not yet corrected 
and the agency disclosed it was seeking civil penalties against 
orion for past violations although no amounts were cited 
once the systemic problems have all been corrected the faa 
will turn its attention toward developing an appropriate 
enforcement package including a proposed fine for past 
violations broderick said 
orions problems stem from safety violations found in early 1987 
violations that attracted little public attention because orions 
55 jets were carrying only cargo 
among the findings by faa inspectors were a shortage of required 
training records inadequate auditing of maintenance facilites 
poor documentation on the qualifications of check pilots who 
decide on the performance of line pilots incomplete flight 
operations manuals instances of pilots failing to go through 
required refresher training and training programs that did not 
meet federal standards 
in a related development tuesday the faa made public a report 
on improvements eastern airlines has made in its own maintenance 
program since the airline was fined a record 95 million two years 
ago 
the faa said that eastern has made substantial progress to 
correct past deficiencies but that some concerns remain about the 
airlines deferred maintenance program and repeated problems with 
certain equipment 
nevertheless eastern officials hailed the latest faa findings 
which showed that corrective actions had been taken in 52 of the 53 
areas cited by the faa two years ago 
we are very pleased this report shows that eastern has 
corrected the deficiencies said kolski

a federal judge approved a 25 million 
settlement tuesday to end a classaction lawsuit brought by former 
owners of montgomery ward amp co catalog stores 
the settlement will affect 852 store owners with the average 
payment totaling 24000 
the owners sued 2 years ago to challenge montgomery wards 
decision to stop taking catalog orders from independent store 
operators 
the agreement reached last month shortly before the case 
reached a jury also requires montgomery ward a retail chain based 
in chicago and owned by mobil corp to drop countersuits to 
recover nearly 2 million in debts from operators 
the settlement is fair reasonable and completely adequate 
considering the hazardous litigation us district judge 
clifford scott green said in approving the settlement tuesday it 
is clear to this court that a jury could have found in favor of the 
defendants 
he also said only about 20 former owners objected to the 
settlement and the objections centered on the distribution of the 
settlement an issue to be handled later 
the opposition included two former store owners who testified 
tuesday 
thomas imerito of wysox pa and frank logue of montrose 
pa said they doubted their payments would cover their costs 
their attorney albert slap of philadelphia said he will appeal 
the assignment of the distribution could split the class into 
warring factions and this kind of opposition reflects on the 
fairness of the settlement he said

construction contracts will drop 4 percent this 
year led by steep declines in office and other commercial building 
and lesser drops in housing and public works projects according to 
a forecast released wednesday 
builders will commit to 2462 billion worth of new contracts in 
all of 1988 compared with 2552 billion last year according to an 
update of the 1988 dodgesweets construction outlook put out by 
mcgrawhill information systems co 
in coming months construction activity will only be slightly 
affected by the stock market crash of last october the mcgrawhill 
unit said 
since october consumer confidence has been shaken federal 
budgetary restraint has been tightened and expectations for the 
economys growth in 1988 have been lowered said george a 
christie chief economist at the company at the same time 
however the outlook for interest rates has brightened 
accordingly so long as a recession is avoided this mix of 
positive and negative developments will not pose a serious threat 
to a creditsensitive industry such as construction he said 
christie predicted nonresidential building would drop 7 percent 
to 895 billion this year led by the highly overbuilt office 
market 
office building activity should drop by 14 percent to 192 
billion and will have to fall even more if the office vacancy 
rate is to shrink from its current 20plus percent he added 
reduced consumer spending and weaker homebuilding together 
could mean a 12 percent drop in the retail sector to 216 
billion while industrial building should pick up by 6 percent 
christie said 
while many wouldbe home buyers remain on the sidelines in the 
wake of the market crash lower interest rates will lure others 
back into the market he said 
even so single family homebuilding will ease 1 percent to 
849 billion and multifamily housing will slump 4 percent to 
263 billion dragged down by a large surplus of apartments he 
added 
the report predicted nonbuilding construction would be pulled 
two ways in 1988 with environmental building increasing by 2 
percent and transportation building down by 4 percent 
as a result total nonbuilding construction will shrink by 1 
percent overall to 451 billion the forecast said

hearing aid is thinking of nicknaming it the jellybean in honor of 
the sweet tooth of its most famous customer 
we used to say it was the size of a cashew nut but he 
reagan reminded me its also the size of a jellybean thomas a 
powers an executive of siemens hearing instruments inc said

director of professional relations for siemens after all hes 
the president 
reagan last week began wearing a 1900 siemens hearing aid 
equipped with a remotecontrol device for screening out unwanted 
noise the publicity helped spur sales of hearing aids to the 
general public 
president reagan deserves recognition for being willing to 
publicly acknowledge that he wears a hearing aid said helmut 
ermann president of the piscataway njbased subsidiary of west 
germanys siemens ag 
ermann said reagan is sending a very powerful message to many 
millions of people all over the world really whose quality of 
life is adversely affected by hearing loss 
reagans new hearing aid for which he was fitted in december 
can be switched to pick up telephone signals preventing the 
whistling sound of feedback that comes from holding the receiver 
against the ear 
reagan dates his hearing loss to the noise of a gun going off by 
his ear during his acting days in hollywood he wears a hearing aid

construction of the tunnel under the english 
channel is roughly on schedule and within budget a cochairman of 
the anglofrench building consortium eurotunnel said wednesday 
alastair morton acknowledged that certain aspects of the 
construction of the 31mile rail tunnel under the english channel 
have fallen behind schedule but said none of the delays so far led 
him to believe the tunnel will not open in 1993 as planned 
the start of tunneling on the french side was delayed when one 
suppliers for the boring machine went bankrupt and the machinery 
had to be finished in the united states but he said the machine is 
now in place and will resume boring shortly 
boring on the english side of the channel began as planned on 
dec 1 and is progressing on schedule he said 
the main problem on the british side is the countrys shortage 
of skilled labor morton said as a result british contractors are 
hiring overseas morton said 
morton said eurotunnel has spent about 300 million pounds or 
525 million of the 750 million pounds it raised in a stock 
offering last year 
eurotunnel must use up the funds raised in the offering before 
it can draw on 5 billion pounds in bank loans also arranged last 
year 
eurotunnel is basically within budget and wont draw on the 
bank loans until the end of 1988 morton said

cotton futures prices soared the limit allowed for daily trading 
wednesday in a technically inspired rally that lifted the market 
out of several weeks in the doldrums 
on other markets soybean futures surged while grains were 
mixed livestock and meat futures were mixed precious metals 
advanced slightly energy futures were mostly lower and 
stockindex futures retreated 
cotton prices for delivery in march may and july all advanced 
the 2 cents a pound daily limit on the new york cotton exchange in 
buying that accelerated sharply when the may contract reached 6320 
cents a pound said ernest simon cotton specialist for the 
investment firm prudentialbache securities inc 
the rally marked the largest daily movement for those contracts 
all of which are based on the 1987 crop since jan 26 when the 
price on all three contracts fell nearly 2 cents a pound 
simon attributed most of the buying to technical rather than 
fundamental factors 
judy ganes an analyst in new york with shearson lehman hutton 
inc said rumors of soviet purchases of us cotton may also have 
contributed to the rally 
thats it as far as fundamentals she said the markets 
just been quiet for a while and today it began to pick up 
the contract for march delivery settled at 6370 cents a pound 
soybean prices soared near the close on the chicago board of 
trade as talk circulated that abc radio news commentator paul 
harvey had reported the discovery of a sudden death syndrome 
affecting soybean crops said jerry gidel an analyst for gh

bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with march at 191 a 
bushel soybeans were 11 cents to 13 cents higher with march at 
633 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange after declining sharply earlier in the day in reaction to 
the agriculture departments monthly cattleonfeed report 
the report showed larger numbers of cattle being fattened for 
slaughter than the market had anticipated that sent futures prices 
lower in early trading but steady cash prices for livestock 
limited the losses analysts said 
live cattle were 25 cent lower to 68 cent higher with february 
at 7180 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 85 cent 
higher with march at 8385 cents a pound hogs were 43 cent lower

pork bellies were unchanged to 28 cent lower with february at 
5570 cents a pound 
precious metals futures advanced slightly on the commodity 
exchange in new york but analysts said the move did not indicate a 
change in the recent downward trend for gold and silver prices 
the dollar appears to be holding steady the balance of trade 
figure is showing improvement and that is leading to a rather weak 
investment demand outlook for gold said stephen w platt metals 
analyst in chicago for dean witter reynolds inc 
gold settled 140 to 180 higher with april at 44920 a troy 
ounce silver was 75 cents to 78 cents higher with march at 645

when foreign corporations and investors look at 
the united states these days they see a big for sale sign 
the weak dollar relatively cheap us stock prices and fears of 
trade protectionism have escalated the already heady pace of 
foreign acquisitions of us companies 
while some us businesses and politicians are worried about the 
impact of the invasion many corporations are jumping to hook up 
with cashrich foreign suitors 
were finding theres a lot of interest out there said ian 
p dunn a managing partner in new york with the british investment 
banker samuel montagu inc were working on a number of deals at 
the moment 
at the same time hostile foreign takeovers are expected to be a 
minority aside from several highprofile hostile battles already 
waged this year foreign buyers mainly are expected to be 
businessoriented suitors interested in longterm benefits rather 
than quick profits 
recent weeks have witnessed a miniwave of foreign buyouts in 
one of the biggest firestone tire and rubber co and tokyobased 
bridgestone corp announced a joint venture by which bridgestone 
would acquire 75 percent of firestones global tire business the 
worlds fifthlargest for 1 billion 
a flurry of smaller deals also have surfaced including 
bank of tokyo ltds acquisition of union bank of los angeles 
for 750 million from britains standard chartered plc 
british publisher pearson plcs 283 million purchase of the 
textbook publisher addisonwesley publishing co 
the 36 million buyout of anspach grossman portugal inc a 
corporate image consultant by wpp group plc the british marketing 
firm that last year acquired advertising giant j walter thompson 
co for 566 million 
still being contested are two of the years biggest proposals 
bat industries plcs hostile 42 billion offer for farmers group 
inc and torontobased campeau corps hostile 54 billion bid for 
federated department stores inc 
the 1988 buying spree had been expected following the rise of 
foreign buyouts in recent years foreign buyers chiefly the 
british and japanese spent an estimated 419 billion in 
acquiring 326 us companies in 1987 according to mergers and 
acquisitions magazine compared with 252 billion in 358 deals 
during 1986 and just 22 billion for 116 takeovers in 1983 
british buyers alone accounted for about 30 billion in us 
acquisitions last year such as british petroleum cos 78 
billion buyout of standard oil co while the japanese took in 
about 6 billion worth of purchases including sony corps 2 
billion acquisition of cbs incs records business 
the speedup in foreign buyouts coincided with the sharp decline 
in the dollars value that has increased foreign buying power in 
the united states over the past two years the japanese yens value 
has risen by about 100 percent against the dollar since early 1985 
and the british pound by 64 percent in that time 
furthermore although us stock prices have rebounded somewhat 
from their lows following octobers market crash they generally 
remain well below their peaks of last summer keeping the market 
prices of many american businesses at cutrate levels 
that presents a unique opportunity for foreign businesses to 
make longdesired strategic expansions into the united states 
bridgestone for example would become a major us competitor for 
the first time through its firestone venture 
such considerations also make it likely that hostile deals will 
be the exception rather than the rule 
what the japanese would like to establish over here is a 
significant presence a more efficient operation said shuehei 
sato head of us merchant banking for japans sanwa bank in 
order to achieve that its necessary to have a good team of 
managers a good working relationship with workers or labor 
unions 
that could only be achieved in the japanese managers mind at 
least by having friendly negotiations he said 
but along with those welcoming new foreign investment are 
critics warning against a tidal wave of foreign ownership ranging 
from members of congress to lee iacocca the entrepreneurial 
chairman of chrysler corp 
critics say foreign takeovers could cause the same problems they 
attribute to the domestic takeover wave of the 1980s including 
lost jobs a weakened industrial base and lost tax revenue 
rep byron dorgan dnd who already has proposed legislation 
to restrict domestic hostile takeovers has asked the general 
accounting office to examine the impact of foreign buyouts and the 
benefits that foreign corporations might enjoy in pursuing us 
companies 
dorgan and others have said the laws of some countries such as 
switzerland gave foreigners legal veils of secrecy and other unfair 
advantages in their attempts to buy us companies 
were going to try to analyze what the threat is and what we 
might want to do in response to it dorgan said in a telephone 
interview

australian history according to newspapers 
holmes a court was considered the richest man in australia until 
the oct 19 world crash that started on wall street the companys 
flagship firm bell group ltd said revaluing of investments 
caused the losses which also were spread across holmes a courts 
bell resources ltd and jn taylor holdings 
a bell group spokesman said the losses reflected a clearing of 
the decks and the adoption of onetime writedowns 
holmes a court has a 30 percent holding in broken hill 
proprietary co ltd one of australias largest companies bhp 
shares dropped sharply during the stock collapse 
all of holmes a courts investments in publicly traded 
companies except for investments in his associated companies were 
written down to market values as of last dec 31 the spokesman 
said 
the bell companies also reported unspecified losses from selling 
investments and said they have sold more investments since dec 31 
holmes a court said he wanted to emphasize that the writedowns 
represented unrealized noncash losses and didnt necessarily 
reflect permanent drops in the value of the investments

restructuring to reflect new conditions and objectives

this year up until last friday when economic statistics suggested 
the economy isnt slowing down significantly despite the stock 
market crash in october

two former executives of beechnut nutritional 
corp were found guilty wednesday of selling appleflavored sugar 
water labeled as pure apple juice for babies a prosecutor said 
i think its an important victory for consumers said thomas 
roche executive assistant us attorney for the eastern district 
of new york who prosecuted the case 
our whole trial team believes that justice has been done he 
said 
the defendants former beechnut president neils l hoyvald and 
a former vice president john f lavery faced hundreds of 
violations of federal food and drug laws and conspiracy and mail 
fraud charges 
lavery was convicted of all 448 counts in the indictment roche 
said 
hoyvald was found guilty on 351 counts all violations of 
federal food and drug law roche said 
the jury couldnt agree on the remaining counts regarding 
hoyvald he said 
the company which also was named in the november 1986 
indictments pleaded guilty last year 
the indictment charged that beechnut shipped adulterated and 
misbranded juice made from phony concentrate throughout the united 
states and overseas from 1978 to 1983 
the juice labeled as 100 percent apple juice for babies was 
actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no 
apple juice the prosecution charged it was bottled at a beechnut 
plant in canajoharie in western new york state 
there has been no evidence that the juice caused any health 
problems the prosecution said 
this case was tried not in terms of being a health hazard 
roche said wednesday it was tried as a fraud case it was our 
view that the evidence in this case demonstrated a massive 
defrauding of beechnuts consumers by beechnut 
us district court judge thomas c platt did not fix a specific 
date for sentencing but it should be within six to eight weeks 
roche said 
roche said both hoyvald and lavery face substantial prison 
terms and substantial fines 
conspiracy is punishable by five years in prison andor a 
10000 fine mail fraud is punishable by five years andor 1000 
food and drug law violations are punishable by three years andor 
10000 roche said 
the two men were allowed to remain free on bail until 
sentencing the prosecutor said 
during closing arguments last monday roche said that evidence 
presented at the threemonth trial never showed hoyvald and lavery 
worrying about selling fake apple juice to babies but they 
were instead concerned about bad publicity and profits 
this is not the way we expect corporate executives in this 
country to operate he said 
hoyvalds attorney brendan sullivan jr argued that the 
government had fallen short by an enormous margin of proving 
his clients guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 
sullivan charged that two key prosecution witnesses who work for 
beechnut had lied when they testified that they had repeatedly 
warned executives that the concentrate was phony 
steven kimelman laverys attorney said his client was a man 
who had nothing to gain by committing a crime lavery was in 
charge of manufacturing at the canajoharie plant 
the jury began deliberations last tuesday it was not told that 
on nov 13 three days before the trial began beechnut pleaded 
guilty to 215 counts of violating federal food and drug charges and 
agreed to pay a 2 million fine 
in may beechnut a subsidiary of nestle inc that is based in 
fort washington pa settled a class action suit that was filed in 
federal court in philadelphia in response to the new york city 
indictment 
in that case beechnut agreed to set up a 5 million cash fund 
for consumers and to provide 25 million in beechnut and 
affiliated products to retailers 
also on the team prosecuting hoyvald and lavery were two 
attorneys from the us justice departments office of consumer 
litigation john r fleder director of that office and kenneth l 
jost a trial attorney

president reagans fiscal 1989 budget cites 
few signs of serious damage to the economy from last years 
stock market plunge in outlining programs to reduce the budget 
deficit to 1295 billion budget documents showed wednesday 
reagans spending outline to be formally submitted on thursday 
will propose record spending of 109 trillion in the fiscal year 
that begins next oct 1 against 9647 billion in receipts 
according to a portion of the document obtained by the associated 
press 
if the policies proposed in this budget are adhered to the 
deficit will decline steadily in future years reagan said in the 
budget report to congress 
the spending proposal likely to produce the least contentious 
budget debate of the reagan presidency because it adheres to a 
budget pact struck last year with congress proposes a 207 
billion reduction from last years spending shortfall of 1502 
billion 
the grammrudman budgetbalancing law calls for a budget deficit 
of no more than 136 billion in fiscal 1989 which begins next oct 
1 
however many private economists contend that the deficit will 
be higher next year even with the steps expected to be outlined in 
the new budget including the smallest defense spending increase 
ever sought by reagan 
the new budget report concedes that the new reagan spending plan 
assumes a declining rate of inflation and falling interest 
rates for both 1988 and 1989 
the budget document calls last octobers stock market collapse 
startling and cites many predictions that the economy would 
soon suffer a downturn or even a return of the great depression 
although it is too soon to determine what the final effects 
will be the initial fears now seem greatly exaggerated the 
budget report states 
despite the sharp reversal in stock prices the economy has 
shown few signs of serious damage it adds 
the new reagan budget assumes that the economy will grow in 1988 
by 24 percent and by 35 percent in 1989 however the budget 
report states that a percentage point lower growth even with no 
change in other economic data could drive up the deficit by an 
additional 63 billion in 1988 and 18 billion in 1989 
reagans new budget document projects that the deficit in the 
current fiscal year fiscal 1988 will total 1467 billion with 
1055 trillion in spending and 9092 billion in receipts 
it projects that the deficit after declining to 1295 billion 
in 1989 will ease to 1042 billion in 1990 to 793 billion in 
1991 and to 511 billion in 1992 
the reagan budget cited expected improvements in exports 
leading to a welcome resurgence of the nations industrial 
sector as the main source of economic strength in the coming 
years 
the eighth and for practical purposes final reagan budget 
takes note of the fact that reagans initial budget plan submitted 
in 1981 was expected to achieve a balanced budget by 1985 
instead the budget has been in deficit reducing the deficit 
is one of the nations central economic policy concerns 
a key reason why the budget still isnt balanced reagans new 
budget report suggests is the drain on the economy of the deep 
198182 recession as well as the fact that congress has been 
unwilling to approve domestic spending cuts he proposed 
many of these proposed reagan reductions were expected to be 
included in the 11 trillion fiscal blueprint being unveiled 
thursday including proposals for transferring government functions 
including parks management and perhaps amtrak railroad service to 
private industry 
but the plan also was being crafted to comply with the spending 
agreement reached last fall in the budget summit between reagan 
and congressional leaders 
since the budget summit agreement spells out overall spending 
and tax levels including allocations for the military domestic 
programs and foreign aid this years battles were expected to 
focus on the details rather than the thrust of the budget 
priorities 
the pact should help smooth the budgets path through congress 
since the balance between domestic and military spending totals is 
annually one of the most difficult 
in addition democratic leaders have pledged to speed the 
process and avoid packing all spending into a single massive bill 
as they did in a 600 billion measure last year 
when reagan pledged in his state of the union address never 
again to sign such legislation he was preaching to a choir 
already converted house majority leader thomas foley dwash 
said this week 
in addition to the requirements of the budget agreement the 
administration is proposing about 14 billion in sales of 
government assets and privatization initiatives to drop the 
deficit to 1295 billion 
the fiscal 1987 deficit was 1504 billion and red ink this 
year is expected to drop to 1467 billion according to 
administration estimates 
the administrations estimates which are more optimistic than 
those of the congressional budget office would normally provoke 
widespread charges of cooking the books for the 
democraticcontrolled congress however the revised grammrudman 
law requires that administration estimates be used in determining 
whether the budget meets its goals 
rep william h gray iii dpa chairman of the house budget 
committee said wednesday he was concerned about congress using too 
rosy a set of figures but he added unduly pessimistic 
assumptions could produce unnecessary battles over additional 
spending cuts or tax increases that in this election year might 
achieve nothing

a former liggett amp myers president ignored 
the issue of smoking and health until the 1964 surgeon generals 
report and asserted that smoking posed no hazard because it never 
harmed him according to evidence released wednesday 
milton e harrington said in testimony read for the jury that 
company officials didnt even discuss a position about smoking 
and health as far as the corporation was concerned 
previous testimony in the trial in which liggett and two other 
cigarette makers are being sued over a smokers lungcancer death 
revealed that liggett had a 25year research program starting in 
1954 to develop a less carcinogenic cigarette that was never 
marketed 
harrington under questioning by plaintiffs attorney marc z 
edell said the 1964 report was a concern to us as it was to 
other people in the industry 
but harrington said i didnt think anything about smoking and 
health other than smoking was not harmful to you in any way 
edell asked the basis for that opinion and harrington replied 
it didnt ever harm me 
edell pressed him for the facts he considered and harrington 
said it was just my belief 
once the surgeon generals report came out harrington said he 
didnt look further into the validity of its findings because it 
wouldnt do any good anyway 
he said he read it as executive vice president shortly before 
becoming president 
edell asked harrington about the adequacy of federally mandated 
warnings on cigarette packs required in 1966 
we didnt care to warn the public about anything we just had 
to put that warning on it wasnt because we liked to it was just 
something we had to do we werent interested in warning the public 
about something harrington replied 
harrington who has since died was 76 when the testimony was 
taken by attorneys for antonio cipollone 64 of lakehurst nj 
who is suing liggett group inc philip morris co and lorillard 
inc for the death of his wife rose liggett group is the parent 
company of liggett amp myers 
it was read in court wednesday by edell and an actor playing the 
role of harrington the executive was a former semiprofessional 
baseball player who joined the company in 1934 and rose through the 
ranks until becoming president and chief operating officer in 1964 
he retired in 1972 
responding to harringtons statements liggett spokesman alan 
hilburg said the witness was nearly 80 years old when he gave 
that testimony 
it wasnt unusual for peoples memories to fade over that 
period of time hilburg said he said he did not know when 
harrington died 
cipollone charges that the three tobacco companies makers of 
the brands mrs cipollone smoked neglected to do enough research 
on cigarettes didnt reveal adequately what they did find and 
failed to put safer cigarettes on the market 
one reason for not marketing the safer cigarette edell argues 
was because to do so would weaken the companies defense against 
lawsuits over their existing products 
referring to a 1968 memorandum from liggetts researcher to 
harrington on a meeting of tobacco company scientific directors 
edell asked what harrington did with similar memos after reading 
them 
i read that and probably referred it to our legal 
department the former executive replied 
why asked edell 
because i thought they should know about it harrington 
replied 
why edell pursued 
that was just our policy they were the people that i was 
holding responsible 
the purpose of the conference detailed in the memo was to 
discuss the scientific aspects of the problems facing the tobacco 
industry with specific emphasis on tobacco and health the 
document said

allegis corp said wednesday that a california 
court has granted its request to order a halt to union plans to 
block the companys restructuring 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers filed a lawsuit in january in california superior court 
contending that allegis plan to sell its nonairline subsidiaries 
and distribute the proceeds to shareholders was illegal 
the union contended that the restructuring would create a higher 
debt load for allegis core business chicagobased united airlines 
in a statement wednesday allegis said the california court held 
that california was an inappropriate place to resolve the question 
and ordered a stay of all proceedings 
it was not the headquarters of the company or where any of the 
transactions took place said nancy hobor a spokeswoman for 
allegis 
the allegis statement said the courts ruling does not prevent 
the union from refiling the action in an appropriate forum 
ms hobor said she did not know if the union has any such plans 
the unions headquarters in washington dc was closed 
wednesday night and a spokesman there could not be reached for 
comment 
the restructuring of allegis which involves the sale of its 
hertz rental car company and westin and hilton international hotel 
subsidiaries will push its debttoequity ratio from about 55 
percent to 80 percent company spokesman matt gonring said in 
january 
he said then that the restructuring would mean selling off 
equity but its not that were incurring new debt 
the company promised its 58 million shareholders it would give 
them a 50 dividend to distribute proceeds from the sales or would 
buy the equivalent amount of shareholders stock which would have 
tax advantages 
in january gonring said the lawsuit was filed in san francisco 
county because that is where the largest proportion of uniteds 
21000 employees in the machinists union are based
