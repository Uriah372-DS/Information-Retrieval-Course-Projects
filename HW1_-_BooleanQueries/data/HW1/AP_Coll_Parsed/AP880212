more than 150 former officers of the 
overthrown south vietnamese government have been released from a 
reeducation camp after 13 years of detention the official vietnam 
news agency reported saturday 
the report from hanoi monitored in bangkok did not give 
specific figures but said those freed friday included an 
excabinet minister a deputy minister 10 generals 115 
fieldgrade officers and 25 chaplains 
it quoted col luu van ham director of the nam ha camp south of 
hanoi as saying all 700 former south vietnamese officials who had 
been held at the camp now have been released 
they were among 1014 south vietnamese who were to be released 
from reeducation camps under an amnesty announced by the communist 
government to mark tet the lunar new year that begins feb 17 
the vietnam news agency report said many foreign journalists and 
a delegation from the australiavietnam friendship association 
attended the nam ha release ceremony 
it said lt gen nguyen vinh nghi former commander of south 
vietnams third army corps and col tran duc minh former director 
of the army infantry officers school expressed gratitude to the 
government for its humane treatment in spite of the fact that most 
of them detainees had committed heinous crimes against the 
country and people 
the prisoners had been held without formal charges or trial 
since north vietnam defeated the usbacked south vietnamese 
government in april 1975 ending the vietnam war 
communist authorities had called the prisoners war criminals and 
said they had to learn how to become citizens of the new society 
small numbers had been released occasionally without publicity 
but the government announced last year that 480 political prisoners 
would be freed to mark national day on sept 2 
on thursday vice minister of information phan quang said 1014 
would be released under the tet amnesty 
he reported a total of 150 prisoners would remain in the camps 
which he said once held 100000 
depending on their repentance they will gradually be released 
within a short period of time quang said 
he said many of the former inmates would return to their 
families in ho chi minh city formerly the south vietnamese capital 
of saigon 
the amnesties apparently are part of efforts by communist party 
chief nguyen van linh to heal internal divisions and improve 
vietnams image abroad

the ripples from the iowa precinct caucuses are 
spreading to new hampshire boosting winners and damaging losers in 
the final days before the nations first primary polls indicate 
vice president george bush who was slipping in new hampshire 
even before his thirdplace iowa finish lost more ground in polls 
this week democratic thirdplace finisher michael dukakis also 
lost support but not as much 
iowa meanwhile has boosted the candidacies of rep richard 
gephardt of missouri and sen bob dole of kansas the democratic 
and republican winners and has aided pat robertson iowas 
surprise secondplace republican finisher the polls indicate 
as recently as two weeks ago bush commanded the new hampshire 
gop field a cbs newsnew york times poll in the last week of 
january had him 22 percentage points over dole the same place hed 
held in polls since november and earlier 
but a crack appeared last week when an abc newswashington post 
poll found bushs lead sharply diminished to 7 percentage points 
after iowas vote monday abc found the spread down to 4 percentage 
points bush 33 dole 29 
in a poll with an error margin of 6 percentage points that 
amounted to a dead heat another survey done for the boston globe 
this week by pollster gary orren had essentially he same result 
bush 29 dole 27 cbs on thursday had it as bush 35 dole 27 
still a big drop for the vice president 
dole got a very big kick out of iowa more than that there is 
some reluctance in the support for bush orren said thursday 
hes shown vulnerability and thats sort of arousing doubts 
people have about him 
the unanswered question is how far bush will fall richard 
morin polling director for the washington post the expectation 
is that he will continue to drop thats been the clear direction 
if voters were leaving bush before iowa it was not clear where 
they were going morin said this week the chief gainers turned out 
to be dole and robertson whose support was up to 10 percent in the 
abc and cbs polls from 6 percent last week and 4 percent two weeks 
ago 
rep jack kemp of new york held steady at 13 percent in the abc 
poll and fell from 16 percent to 12 percent in the cbs poll 
analysts said he now may be challenged by robertson for third place 
in new hampshire 
kemp was gaining last week iowa ended that said morin 
iowas effect on the democratic race probably is in the battle 
for second place not first pollsters said massachusetts gov 
dukakis despite finishing third in iowa maintained a strong lead 
in new hampshire but he no longer had the huge 49 percent support 
indicated in an nbcwall street journal poll in november 
three polls indicated a drop in support for dukakis to 36 
percent in the abcpost survey this week from 41 percent last week 
to 35 percent in the globes survey from 38 percent last week and 
to 38 percent in the cbs poll from 40 percent in late january 
a fourth new poll however done for wbztv in boston wrctv 
in washington and the boston herald said dukakis support had 
risen from 36 percent at the end of january to 44 percent this week 
its a big lead for dukakis no matter whose poll youre 
looking at and a strong one too said jeff alderman chief of 
polling for abc news he said 58 percent of dukakis backers told 
abc they supported him strongly 
the win in iowa transformed gephardt who had singledigit 
support in new hampshire as recently as last month the cbs poll 
had him at 19 percent up from 7 percent in late january abcs 
poll put him this week at 22 percent up from 13 percent last week 
the globe had him at 18 percent up from 8 and the wbz poll had 
him at 17 up from 8 last month 
poll results were more mixed on gephardts chief rival sen 
paul simon of illinois the secondplace finisher in iowa he moved 
to 18 percent from 13 percent in abcs poll to 13 from 11 in wbzs 
and fell in the globes to 12 from 17 he held about even in the 
cbs poll at 15 percent this week 
movement is taking place at the bottom as well as the top of the 
pack former sen gary hart of colorado who had 11 percent in the 
wbz and globe polls last week fell to singledigit support after 
winning just 1 percent in iowa hart and former arizona gov bruce 
babbitt also a poor finisher in iowa went from 7 percent in abcs 
new hampshire poll last week to 4 percent this week

the parents of a student slain when he 
apparently stumbled onto a reputed mexican drug lords party have 
dropped a 2 billion lawsuit against the man saying a trial would 
rekindle painful memories 
alberto radelat a dental student and journalist john walker 
were tortured and killed in february 1985 in guadalajara mexico 
and authorities there said they believed the men were executed 
because they were mistaken for drug agents 
on jan 29 dr felipe radelat and his wife ana filed a wrong 
death action against reputed drug lord rafael caro quintero whom 
authorities have blamed for the deaths 
the younger radelat and walker had apparently entered a 
restaurant where quintero was holding an afterhours party 
a witness told the radelats that their son and walker were 
stabbed with icepicks and switchblades before they were dumped in a 
crude grave outside guadalajara where their bodies were found in 
june 1985 
on thursday radelat said he dropped the suit a week after 
filing it because it would revive memories the family had tried to 
put behind them 
my wife had settled down and this brought it all up again 
he said we dont want any more bad memories it was a sad 
experience i hope no one ever has to go through it 
quintero was among nine people indicted jan 6 by federal 
officials in los angeles in connection with the deaths of drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena and his pilot 
who were killed about a week after radelat and walker were slain 
quintero is in a mexican jail charged with all four deaths us 
authorities indicted him and the others in camarenas death in an 
effort to bring them to justice if mexican authorities dont 
prosecute them 
radelat said he filed the lawsuit because the us government 
had not indicted quintero in the other deaths 
we were disappointed they us officials indicted quintero 
just for the drug agent not the other americans radelat said 
we wanted to do this suit not so much for the money but just to 
do justice for our son

price supports for peanuts grown under 1988 
quotas will be 61527 per ton an increase of 780 from last 
year the agriculture department said friday 
deputy secretary peter c myers said the increase was required 
by a formula in the law which takes rising production costs into 
consideration 
the annual quota is set at a level equal to the estimated 
quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible uses 
seed and related purposes 
production of nonquota peanuts which can be grown for peanut 
oil and meal and for export will be supported at 14975 per ton 
unchanged from last year myers said 
in setting the support for nonquota peanuts officials are 
required to consider certain factors including the demand for oil 
and meal the expected prices for other vegetable oils and meals 
and the foreign demand for peanuts

the end was bitter his helmet dented from the 
combat of the campaign and true to form retired fourstar gen 
alexander m haig jr reined in his dark horse quest for the 
presidency in a pugnacious mood 
haig made clear that his new objective was not to seek the keys 
to the white house for himself but to deny them to vice president 
george bush 
from the very beginning when he announced im throwing my 
helmet into the ring the 63yearold former secretary of state 
never rose above the low single digits in public opinion polls 
he stopped campaigning in the iowa caucuses in frustration that 
his message and his personality had not taken hold 
this is hangover day haig said when the iowa votes were 
counted and he ended up with less than 3 percent of the vote in the 
gop field 
throughout his campaign haig described himself as the darkest 
of dark horses 
his political picture never brightened perhaps because he 
failed to find a way to do what he himself said he had to do to win 
ive learned the secret of life its in marketing haig 
told a denver audience early in the campaign 
and thats what im trying to do today marketing 
after iowa haig had trouble finding a silver lining 
im in it to the bitter end and that bitter end may be the 
inability to raise enough money to stay in it he said 
haig has been supreme allied commander in europe and white 
house chief of staff as well as secretary of state and presidential 
contender 
in all of those roles he demonstrated a vivid sometimes 
pungent grasp of the english language 
when his hopes for iowa were still high haig told audiences 
i think its important that a city slicker like al haig whos 
been abroad and lived in our nations capital perhaps too long 
doesnt come out here and tell agricultural experts how to suck 
eggs 
complaining about the reagan administrations supplyside 
economic policies he said they bore the mark of ideological 
religiosity 
he himself described some of his more obscure references and 
word combinations as haigspeak 
haig sensed a measure of public reluctance to put a former 
fourstar general in the white house and his first television 
commercials were designed to counter that 
one listed the names of the dozen generals who have served as 
president asserting that none of the nations eight wars began in 
their administrations 
ive led troops in battle seen the horror of war i know the 
imperative of peace the former general said asserting the need 
to elect a president with strength skill and understanding 
he said the idea of a nuclearfree world is bizarre 
asserting that soviet nuclear weapons can only be detered by other 
nuclear weapons not eliminated 
when the stock market crashed last october haig said washington 
had sown the seeds of disaster 
overnight the famous bull market of the eighties was eaten 
alive by the most infamous bear market in our financial history 
he said attributing the markets nose dive to a pervasive lack 
of confidence in our governments ability to deal with budget and 
trade deficits 
bush was a preoccupation for much of the haig campaign 
haig tried repeatedly to pin down the vice president on what 
advice he gave to reagan in the irancontra scandal 
were you in the cockpit haig said in typically colorful 
language or were you on an economy ride in the back of the 
plane

a court ruled friday that an egg 
producer who kept his 2000 hens in small cages was not guilty of 
cruelty to animals as alleged by animal rights activists 
the verdict is a great relief it would have been too much to 
be found guilty of cruelty to my 2000 hens karl wettre was 
quoted as saying by the national ntb news agency after his 
acquittal 
the national society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
claimed that by keeping hens in small cages wettre violated 
national legislation to allow animals natural development and 
behavior 
but the court found that wettre observed norwegian regulations 
stipulating that a hen should have at least 112 square inches of 
cage space in which to live 
nspca chairman toralf metveit was quoted as saying im 
disappointed but not surprised 
the society was ordered pay 15600 in court costs

strategists for jack kemps presidential 
campaign say george bushs poor showing in iowa coupled with 
kemps toughtalking ads against bob dole could put kemp in the 
running for the republican nomination 
before last mondays iowa caucuses kemp had been on a roll in 
new hampshire using an effective advertising campaign and the 
endorsement of the influential concord monitor to help broaden 
support 
but even as his bid to become the conservative alternative to 
dole and bush took shape the new york congressman faced the 
possibility of being swept out of the race by former television 
evangelist pat robertson 
using his secondplace finish in iowa kemp came in fourth 
robertson was trying to move kemp aside and take the mantle of true 
conservative a poll of new hampshire voters by the boston globe 
thursday night indicated robertson had drawn even with kemp among 
potential republican voters in next tuesdays primary 
charles douglas kemps new hampshire campaign manager says the 
buffalo congressman wants to finish second or third in a cluster 
with bush and dole 
we want to be in the 283031 percent range with them 
douglas said 
he conceded that kemp cannot afford another fourthplace finish 
saying we need to do well here so we can raise money and 
continue on to the south we need to have at least a close third 
here 
kemp spent most of the week in new hampshire making his case at 
coffee klatches before high school students and in speeches to the 
party faithful he is hopeful that his energetic persontoperson 
style and strong conservative message will make him the 
conservative alternative 
john buckley is kemps chief campaign strategist 
what you saw tonight buckley said after kemp spoke before 
800 republicans in nashua earlier this weekwas kemp making an 
appeal to the heart and soul of the reagan vote in new hampshire 
we consider that to be the largest single vote in the republican 
primary electorate 
buckley said bushs thirdplace finish in iowa presented kemp 
with a new hampshire opportunity he never thought he would see 
it was a lucky break that the guy who got severely wounded in 
iowa was george bush someone we never thought we could beat in 
the new hampshire primary 
kemps strategy had focused on dole because as buckley put it 
dole is extraordinarily vulnerable in new hampshire because of 
his predilection for raising taxes his four different positions on 
oil import fees and his wanting to cut social security in a state 
that has an elderly republican electorate 
we learned a lesson last month in iowa buckley said the 
news media was interested in bushdole dolebush bushdole 
almost as if they were the only two variables 
the lesson was that by being very specific on issues in a 
tough hardhitting way we could pry the door open to get people 
to take a look at kemp 
robertson is now running ads in new hampshire saying he is the 
best alternative to bush and dole and noting that he has already 
beaten kemp 
but buckley says robertson cant repeat his showing in iowa 
because of an inherently negative message that wont be effective 
in new hampshire 
for all the voters who may be more comfortable with the gloom 
and doom and dour message of pat robertson that were going to 
hell in a handbasket there are many more who will respond to a 
positive conservative message buckley said 
im a conservative kemp told a living room full of 
republicans in milford but ill tell you what folks some 
things need money spent on them weve got to shelter the homeless 
weve got to feed and clothe and take care of people who cant take 
care of themselves and weve got to have a strong defense

about 90 soldiers have been 
arrested and face possible death sentences stemming from a coup 
attempt in bophuthatswana leaders of the tribal homeland said 
friday 
rebel soldiers staged the takeover bid wednesday detaining 
homeland president lucas mangope and several top cabinet officials 
for 15 hours before south african soldiers and police rushed to the 
homeland rescuing the leaders and restoring them to power 
at least three soldiers and two civilians died in the uprising 
bophuthatswanas minister of justice g godfrey mothibe told a 
news conference that those arrested have been charged with high 
treason and if convicted could be sentenced to death he said the 
accused were to appear in court monday 
all those arrested in the coup attempt have been described as 
young troops the most senior being a warrant officer 
during the coup rebel soldiers installed as head of state rocky 
malebanemetsing leader of the opposition progressive peoples 
party 
malebanemetsing escaped capture and his whereabouts remained 
unknown officials said several unsubstantiated reports said he 
fled to nearby botswana 
warrant officer mtf phiri described by mangope as one of the 
coup leaders was arrested friday in mmabatho capital of the 
nominally independent homeland officials said 
bophuthatswana which has a population of 17 million spread 
over seven separate land blocks is one of 10 tribal homelands in 
south africa about half of south africas 26 million blacks live 
in the homelands none of which are recognized internationally 
hennie riekert the homelands defense minister said south 
african troops were to remain in bophuthatswana but will not become 
a permanent presence 
bophuthatswanas foreign minister solomon rathebe defended south 
africas intervention 
the fact that the south african government was invited 
to assist in this drama is not anything new nor peculiar to 
bophuthatswana rathebe said but why south africa one might 
ask because she is the only country with whom bophuthatswana 
enjoys diplomatic relations and has formal agreements 
mangope described the mutual defense treaty between the homeland 
and south africa as similar to the nato agreement referring to 
the atlantic military alliance he did not elaborate 
asked about the causes of the coup mangope said we granted 
people freedom perhaps to the extent of planning a thing like 
this 
the uprising began around 2 am wednesday when rebel soldiers 
took mangope and his top ministers from their homes to the national 
sports stadium 
on wednesday evening south african soldiers and police stormed 
the stadium rescuing mangope and his cabinet 
south african president pw botha and three of his cabinet 
ministers flew to mmabatho late wednesday and met with mangope the 
homelands only president since it was declared independent in 1977 
the south african government has said without producing 
evidence that the outlawed african national congress may be linked 
to the coup 
the anc based in lusaka zambia dismissed the claims and said 
south africas actions showed that it maintains tight control over 
the homeland governments the group seeks to topple the pretoria 
government 
the african national congress and other antigovernment 
organizations consider the homelands part of an apartheid system 
designed to fragment the black majority and deny them political 
rights in south africa

a senior panamanian diplomat broke with his 
countrys militarydominated government friday declaring he could 
no longer in good conscience serve a regime stained by 
corruption illigitimacy and dishonesty 
lawrence chewning fabrega minister counselor at panamas 
mission to the organization of american states here told a news 
conference his decision to resign was triggered by a speech he was 
ordered to give at an oas ceremony on wednesday 
chewning had said in the speech that the reagan administration 
was attempting to overthrow the panamanian government and was 
waging a campaign of moral and economic aggresion against 
panama 
these remarks were not written by me nor did they represent 
the way i feel or think chewning said adding that they were 
prepared by panamas ambassador to the oas roberto leyton and the 
panamanian foreign ministry 
chewnings resignation followed an extraordinary week in which 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega was indicted by two 
federal grand juries in florida on drugrelated charges and was 
accused by former associates before a congressional panel of 
engaging in an array of corrupt activities 
speaking through a translator at oas headquarters chewning 
said my conscience my dignity and my deep religious beliefs 
prevent me from continuing to be used as an instrument of a 
government characterized by corruption illigitimacy and 
dishonesty 
panamas oas mission had no statement on chewnings resignation 
and ambassador leyton was not available for comment gabriel lewis 
a former panamanian ambassador who has been lobbying in washington 
against noriegas rule said chewnings resignation proves there 
are worthy individuals in the panamanian government who refuse 
to continue supporting noriega 
chewning said he did not resign on the day of the oas ceremony 
because he felt it was inappropriate given the nature of the 
event the occasion was the formal incorporation of west germany 
into an international agreement designed to guarantee the 
neutrality of the panama canal once the waterway comes under 
panamanian control in the year 2000 
in his speech wednesday chewning had said the united states in 
pursuing a hostile attitude toward the panamanian government was 
attempting to evade its treaty pledge to relinquish control over 
the canal 
on friday he said he believes the united states will faithfully 
comply with its commitments 
chewning said he was not seeking political asylum in the united 
states and was confident he would not be the target of reprisals by 
the panamanian government 
he will be ineligible to remain in this country because his visa 
allowing him to remain here is valid only so long as he maintained 
his status as a diplomat he said he has about a month to decide 
what to do in the future 
chewning 46 served in the oas post for a year and a half he 
previously had worked in panamas foreign ministry its embassy in 
belgium and its embassy in washington accredited to the us 
government 
he and his wife are expecting their fourth child

pete du pont struggling to keep his 
presidential candidacy alive in the final days before the new 
hampshire primary lashed out friday at fellow republicans bob dole 
and jack kemp 
at a news conference in this snowbound city du pont said 
what bob dole says seems to depend on what state hes in he 
also called kemp a big spender 
with the departure of alexander haig from the republican 
presidential race on friday du pont a former governor of 
delaware ranks at the bottom of the fivecandidate field 
he conceded that to stay in the race after tuesdays primary 
you have to do well you have to start beating somebody 
du pont had kind words for haig a former secretary of state 
calling him a credit to this process and saying he brought a 
little spice to the debate 
but he had no kind words for anyone else 
asked about his prospects du pont said all of new 
hampshires in flux now that the vice president is in a free fall 
vice president george bushs standing as the clear frontrunner 
among new hampshire republicans has eroded since his embarrassing 
thirdplace finish in the iowa precinct caucuses on monday 
du pont called the upcoming days the four most volatile of 
this campaign 
focusing on dole du pont said i dont think you can go to 
iowa and talk to farmers about how many dollars youve appropriated 
and then come to new hampshire and avoid it 
he also said the kansas senator had told iowans that he would 
not pledge to oppose any tax increases and then came to new 
hampshire and said he would veto a tax increase new hampshire 
voters have a reputation for solid opposition to tax increases 
du pont also said that dole had supported an import fee on 
foreign oil in iowa but in new hampshire he says hell veto it 
as for kemp a congressman from new york du pont said hes a 
big spender in fact hes got a spending record in the congress 
that is even more liberal than pat schroeder a democratic 
congresswoman from colorado or paul simon the illinois senator 
who is running for the democratic presidential nomination 
so i dont think on tuesday the people of new hampshire are 
going to fall for a snow job he said

the son of a man who lived nearly 40 years in 
the united states and then died in a yugoslav prison after being 
convicted of nazi war crimes challenged us officials friday to 
admit they wrongly extradited his father to a communist court 
rad artukovic in a 135page report submitted to the justice 
department said the department used fraudulent evidence to send 
his father andrija artukovic to face a sham trial in 
yugoslavia two years ago 
the elder artukovic died last month at age 88 while awaiting 
execution in a yugoslav prison 
the only way the u s government could get him was through 
fraud artukovic told a news conference before leaving for los 
angeles to join a federal courthouse vigil in honor of his late 
father 
he said his father has become a hero to people from his native 
croatia now a part of yugoslavia 
andrija artukovic who was a cabinet minister in the nazi puppet 
state of croatia was called butcher of the balkans by the 
yugoslav government and accused of ordering the deaths of thousands 
of people during his trial he was described as as overseer of a 
grisly network of concentration camps 
rad artukovic 39 said his father was minister of the interior 
had no military responsibilities and ordered no deaths 
he said his father was not mentally competent to stand trial 
us officials had declared him senile and legally blind when he 
was extradited 
tom stewart spokesman for the justice departments criminal 
division said a copy of artukovics report had been received by 
the office of special investigations and was being reviewed by 
investigators who handle allegations of war crimes 
hes done a marvelous job of defending his fathers 
reputation but the matter was dealt with in the courts stewart 
said 
artukovic said in the report that both his fathers extradition 
and the trial in zagreb relied mainly on false testimony from bajro 
avdic a man who claimed to have been a military escort for his 
father 
the report said avdic was not an escort and was not in the 
places he claimed to be when atrocities allegedly occurred it also 
claims he made up the killings attributed to artukovic 
i ask the justice department to go into court and revoke the 
order they obtained through fraud artukovic said accusing us 
officials of collusion with the communist government in yugoslavia 
artukovic said he hopes for a renunciation of the extradition to 
invalidate the yugoslav trial 
artukovic said he and two of his four sisters visited their 
father during his imprisonment in yugoslavia but his mother ana 
never saw her husband after he was extradited the family lives in 
seal beach calif his father for many years had been a bookkeeper 
for a los angeles construction company 
the younger artukovic a stock trader said he worked for two 
years to research the report on what he said was false evidence 
against his father and is sending copies to members of the senate 
judiciary committee and the senate foreign relations committee 
he said the justice department went along with whatever was 
given it by the yugoslavian government but could not collect enough 
evidence to deport his father 
artukovic said yugoslavia accused his father of war crimes to 
neutralize him as a croatian political leader he said most other 
members of the croatian wartime cabinet were executed as war 
criminals but allied officials found no evidence against him and he 
was allowed to live freely in ireland and later the united states

a court on friday convicted fugitive guerrilla 
leader abu nidal and two of his palestinian followers in the 1985 
grenade and rifle attack that killed 16 people in a crowd of 
holiday travelers at romes airport 
abu nidal and another fugitive rashid elhamieda were 
sentenced to life in prison the only defendant in custody mahmoud 
ibrahim khaled was given a 30year term 
more than 80 people were injured in the dec 27 1985 assault on 
the checkin counters of twa and the israeli carrier el al at 
leonardo da vinci airport 
four americans were killed including an 11yearold girl on a 
trip with her family to new york 
elhamieda described as a top lieutenant in abu nidals fatah 
revolutionary council was accused along with abu nidal of 
organizing the attack neither he nor abu nidal took part in it 
the assault occurred at the same hour as a similar strike at 
viennas airport also blamed on abu nidals followers 
four people including two terrorists and an american died in 
the vienna attack and 47 people were injured two surviving 
palestinian terrorists were convicted of murder by a vienna jury 
and sentenced to life in prison 
the rome jury of two judges and six civilians apparently heeded 
a plea for leniency for khaled the only survivor of the fourman 
commando team he could be released on parole in a little less than 
15 years 
earlier in the day his courtappointed lawyer said he could not 
possibly ask for acquittal for the 20yearold khaled who admitted 
his guilt 
instead the lawyer epifanio ales reread for the jury khaleds 
own statements about his childhood in a refugee camp in lebanon 
his parents death in an israeli bombing and his taking up of arms 
when he was 10 years old 
khaled was a patriot who wanted a palestine free of the 
israelis ales said in his plea for mercy 
the lawyer asked the jury to remember that italian courts for 
years were merciful to men who had killed adulterous wives and 
their lovers under a now vanishing crime of honor standard 
ales said defending the confessed terrorist was an anguished 
task and that it was particularly painful to listen to the 
testimony of an american journalist about how his daughter 
11yearold natasha simpson died in the gunfire 
victor l simpson news editor for the associated press in rome 
described in court how he threw himself and the girl to the 
terminal floor in a futile attempt to shield her from the bullets 
according to the trial indictment four israeli security guards 
fired back killing three of the four members of the attack squad 
and wounding khaled 
the steelbarred holding cage for khaled was empty on friday he 
chose to stay in his prison cell exercising his right under 
italian law not to attend his trial he only attended court dec 
15 the trials opening session 
the trial was based largely on hours of pretrial statements by 
khaled who told investigators that the terrorists were trained in 
lebanons syriancontrolled bekaa valley and took their orders from 
headquarters in damascus the syrian capital 
investigators believed elhamieda provided the terrorists with 
their weapons and gave them final instructions during several 
meetings in rome then checked out of a hotel and fled italy at 
virtually the same hour the raid was launched 
prosecutor francesco deleo had requested conviction and life 
sentences for the three defendants saying khaleds statements made 
clear the airport strikes were linked to several terrorist attacks 
in europe this decade 
italy does not have capital punishment 
abu nidals group has been blamed for more than 100 attacks 
across europe asia and the middle east since 1972 
he split from yasser arafats palestine liberation organization 
in 1973 
an international arrest warrant has been issued for abu nidal 
whose real name is sabri albanna 
abu nidal is a nom de guerre which means father of the 
struggle 
he originally based his group in syria but was expelled and is 
believed to operate out of lebanon with his followers trained in 
libya 
lawyers for both fugitive defendants asked the jury for 
acquittal for lack of evidence they said they would appeal the 
verdict 
khaleds lawyer said he had not yet decided about an appeal 
all three defendants were charged with massacre and with illegal 
possession of arms

empty bullfrog county created from 
scrubland in a bid to assure the state of federal dollars should 
the government build a nuclear dump in nevada violates the state 
constitution a judge has ruled 
judge david zenoff said thursday the county stretched its legal 
limits every which way and left too many constitutional issues 
hanging in the air 
nye county from which unpopulated bullfrog county was carved 
had challenged the 1987 legislatures creation of the states 18th 
county 
zenoff a former state supreme court justice brought in to hear 
the case issued the ruling after less than 30 minutes of oral 
arguments in district court 
zenoff said the governors authority to appoint three 
commissioners for the county ran contrary to the democratic 
process and contributed to its failure to provide representative 
government 
i cannot in good conscience uphold this law he said 
obviously were very pleased said nye county district 
attorney phil dunleavy it confirms what weve been saying all 
along as far as im concerned bullfrog county is dead and it 
should be 
attorney frank daykin representing the legislature and bullfrog 
county said it would be up to the legislative commission to decide 
whether to appeal zenoffs ruling to the state supreme court 
the commissions next meeting is scheduled for wednesday 
we usually dont accept defeat in the legislature said 
commission chairman lawrence jacobsen 
legislators created the county out of a 144squaremile chunk of 
nye county as a way of giving the state control over federal funds 
available for the proposed yucca mountain in southern nevada is 
one of three sites under consideration 
had bullfrog county been selected the us government would 
have had to compensate the staterun county an estimated 8 million 
to 25 million a year officials said 
personally i hope the legislature doesnt appeal it because 
its brought enough embarrassment to nevada and should be allowed 
to lay in peace dunleavy said the legislature needs to 
rethink its approach to the problem 
nye county stands to lose revenue should the new county remain 
on the books 
gov richard bryan who signed the law creating the county into 
effect issued only a brief statement upon learning of zenoffs 
decision 
this apparently resolves the bullfrog county issue unless the 
legislature chooses to appeal he said 
karen zupon the governors press secretary said bryan has 
always said hell abide by the courts decision hes not a party 
to the suit and he hasnt said anything about whether he thinks it 
should be appealed 
nye county challenged the countys creation on 37 different 
legal grounds in a 92page brief its major complaint was bullfrog 
countys failure to provide representative government 
zenoff agreed saying it was not answerable to the people 
among other things he said the law made no provisions for a 
judicial district or legislative representation for the county

secretary of state george p shultz will go to 
the middle east in two weeks to try to promote twostage 
negotiations between israel and jordan on palestinian selfrule 
a brief state department announcement friday said shultz would 
make the trip at the end of the month for the purpose of 
advancing the middle east peace process 
other us officials said he would set out for the middle east 
about 24 hours after returning from feb 2123 talks in mosocw and 
visit egypt jordan israel and possibly saudi arabia 
shultz plans to remain in the area until he joins president 
reagan for a summit meeting with the leaders of the 15 north 
atlantic treaty organization countries in brussels beginning march 
2 
the soviets have been notified in advance that shultz intends to 
sound out foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze about an 
international peace conference that would be a backdrop for 
arabisraeli negotiations 
their moscow talks will center mostly on prospects for a treaty 
to sharply reduce us and soviet longrange nuclear missiles and 
for a withdrawal of the red army from afghanistan after an 
occupation of more than eight years 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and shultz have registered 
their reluctance to having the soviets play a prominent role in a 
middle east settlement but jordans king hussein wants the 
participation of all the big powers including moscow 
according to us and other sources who declined to be 
identified shultz will advance a twostep plan that would open 
negotiations in april between israel and a mixed 
jordanianpalestinian delegation and then resume in december to 
work on an overall middle east settlement 
all options including statehood for the palestinians would be 
open at that point 
shultz reaffirmed monday night in a meeting with american 
foreign policy experts that the us approach to a final settlement 
is based on israel trading territory for peace 
that could cause severe political problems for shamir because 
many of his supporters are against relinquishing land the arabs 
lost to israel in the 1967 sixday war 
at the same time the united states has not endorsed palestinian 
statehood president reagans formula outlined in a 1982 speech 
and still us policy proposed linking the west bank and gaza to 
jordan 
reagan said flatly that the united states will not support the 
establishment of an independent palestinian state in the 
territories and would also not support annexation or permanent 
control by israel 
shultzs trip is designed to show a commitment to aiding the 15 
million palestinian arabs who live on the west bank and in gaza and 
to ending violence in the israeliheld territories 
sources said shultzs overriding goal was to promote 
negotiations between israel and the arabs possibly in the 
framework of a mideast peace conference 
they stressed that the framework was incidental to holding 
direct talks on the palestinian issue and that all approaches to 
getting the two sides to the table would be considered 
the peace conference idea has drawn objections from shamir but 
it has the support of israeli foreign minister shimon peres and 
possibly king hussein 
on his last visit to the region in october shultz said he 
understood why shamir would be reluctant to hold negotations in a 
way that gave the soviet union a chance to play an influential role 
the soviets generally side with the arabs in their dispute with 
israel and do not have diplomatic relations with jerusalem 
about 96 percent of the residents of the west bank and gaza are 
palestinian arabs jewish settlers who were banned from the west 
bank during jordans control from 1948 to 1967 have established 
villages religious schools and synagogues there 
hussein has accused the reagan administration of being 
hopelessly onesided toward israel but a recent us diplomatic 
emissary philip c habib was reported to have detected a 
positive attitude in talks with the king in amman 
assistant secretary of state richard w murphy returned from the 
middle east on thursday and reported to shultz on his meetings with 
leaders of syria saudia arabia egypt and israel as well as with 
british and french officials

the government should ease back on acreage 
controls for the 1989 wheat crop the national association of wheat 
growers said friday 
frank johannsen association president said greater acreage 
should be permitted so the united states can keep filling a growing 
export demand for the last two years wheat farmers have been 
required to idle 275 percent of their base acreage in order to 
qualify for federal supports 
the agriculture department is to announce the 1989 wheat program 
by june 1 johannsen a wheat farmer from bayard neb said the 
association wants the acreage reduction be held to no more than 20 
percent 
johannsen said us wheat stockpiles are expected to drop by 30 
percent this season the largest annual decline in more than 20 
years 
a 1989 acreage reduction of less than 20 percent could be 
justified if usda maintains its current export subsidy programs he 
said 
since we dont know what will happen after the november 
elections our market outlook is somewhat cloudy thus making it 
more difficult to forecast export sales opportunities johannsen 
said in a statement

a member of israels parliament arrived in 
athens on friday to join palestinian deportees in a planned voyage 
back to israel but two organizers said they still had not obtained 
a ship 
the president of greeces main seamens union meanwhile said 
israeli agents had used threats and pressure to block the 
plosponsored trip that would carry 130 palestians deported by 
israel to the israeli port of haifa 
union leader antonis dalakogiorgis also revealed that the 
israeli sea officers union had warned they would boycott greek 
vessels if greek seamen continued backing the plo effort 
the journey of return is designed to focus attention on 
israels use of deportations to punish palestinians in the 
territories it captured in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
parliament member mohammed miari appeared at a news conference 
at an athens hotel alongside bassam abu sharif the chief spokesman 
for plo chairman yasser arafat 
miari a member of the leftwing progressive list for peace 
said he was told that the israeli government will put on trial 
all those who participate in the trip and said there were moves 
in parliament to strip him of his parliamentary immunity 
two other parliament members tawfiq zaiad and charlie biton 
were among 11 israelis who arrived thursday in cyprus to join the 
voyage when it stops there about 20 israelis plan to make the trip 
the trip is modeled after the voyage of the exodus which tried 
to take jewish refugees to palestine in 1947 but was turned back by 
british authorities miriam algazi one of the israelis who arrived 
in cyprus on thursday also took part in the exodus voyage 
at the news conference miari backed the right of the deported 
palestinians people to return to their homeland 
he said he hoped the trip would open a new window for just 
peace in the middle east 
but there was increasing doubt that any ship would be able to 
sail soon although the plo has gathered hundreds of deportees 
observers and journalists in athens and cyprus to take part 
two members of the ninemember voyage steering committee in 
athens told the associated press that the plo did not have a firm 
contract to charter a vessel because several companies had backed 
out of tentative commitments 
we dont have a boat yet said abduljawad saleh the 
deported mayor of the west bank town of bireh 
there is not a concrete ship as of this moment said another 
member of the steering committee who insisted on anonymity 
the voyage was initially scheduled to start on tuesday but the 
plo diplomatic representative in athens fouad albittar said 
thursday the voyage had been delayed because many shipowners 
had backed away from contracts 
however he then promised that the voyage would begin by early 
saturday morning from greeces main piraeus harbor saying a boat 
had been found 
we are still insisting that the boat will sail abu sharif 
said friday he reaffirmed the time schedule given by bittar but 
added an element of uncertainty 
im sure we will find and have found according to mr 
bittar a brave captain for the voyage he said 
piraeus harbor authority officials said at noon friday the plo 
had not submitted documents legally required 24 hours before a ship 
can be brought in or out 
dalakogiorgis president of the panhellenic union of merchant 
seamen said that israeli agents had threatened greek shipping 
companies and individual seamen about the voyage 
seamen working on ships that the plo might have chartered 
received telephone threats from the israelis and shipping companies 
were also under intense pressure from them dalakogiorgis said 
i personally received threatening phone calls threatening my 
life not to proceed with this dalakogiorgis said 
dalakogiorgis distributed copies of a telex from the israeli sea 
officers union saying we would have no choice but to boycott 
greek vessels in israeli ports if the voyage goes as planned 
no one from the israeli union headquartered in haifa could be 
found for comment friday 
shipping sources in piraeus speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the captain of the first ship chartered to make the voyage had 
also been threatened 
they said that zannes kouloumbis of the malteseflagged silver 
paloma was warned of an israeli attack during the voyage and told 
his life was in danger 
the ships owners who operate a regular ferry service to 
israel dropped out

two us navy warships under orders to assert 
international navigation rights were deliberately bumped by two 
soviet warships on friday after moving within 12 miles of russias 
black sea coastline the pentagon said 
no one was injured and damage to the two ships was described as 
light 
but the administration immediately lodged a strong protest with 
the soviet ambassador here saying the vessels had done nothing 
provocative and were operating in accord with international law 
as secretary of state george p shultz said just a week ago 
we are prepared to deal with the best and worst of soviet 
behavior said rudolph boone a state department spokesman 
we intend to continue exercising our rights under 
international law the soviets are obligated to comply with their 
international commitments 
navy officials said during a pentagon briefing there was no 
question that the cruiser uss yorktown and destroyer uss caron had 
been struck deliberately by a soviet frigate and a smaller coastal 
patrol boat respectively 
the soviet warships broadcast a warning beforehand saying they 
were authorized to strike your ship with one of ours said 
capt gerry flynn a top aide to the chief of naval operations 
the two soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on the 
american vessels which were as we would say in the navy 
shouldered out of the way flynn added 
the yorktown and caron maintained their course and speed despite 
the bumping eventually steaming farther from the soviet coast 
flynn said 
the latest report i have now is that both ships are operating 
routinely in the black sea as planned he said 
flynn and other pentagon officials said they could not recall a 
similar incident of deliberate bumping during operations in the 
black sea the soviets strongly protested a similar deployment by 
the same two ships in march 1986 but did nothing at the time to 
physically interfere with their passage 
the soviet union claimed friday the us navy ships violated its 
border ignored warnings and dangerously maneuvered in soviet 
territorial waters 
it was a routine passage and we were doing nothing provocative 
at all flynn countered we view this with considerable 
concern 
according to cmdr richard schiff a navy lawyer who appeared 
with flynn the yorktown and caron were operating off the crimean 
peninsula in what the navy calls its assertion of rights 
program an effort to periodically steam through contested waters 
to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas 
unlike the united states which claims a threemile territorial 
limit the soviet union claims a 12mile limit along its coast 
schiff explained the united states will accept such a claim but 
any country claiming 12 miles must allow for innocent passage by 
the ships of all nations he said 
the soviet union tries to insist that foreign ships stick to 
specified sea lanes when making an innocent passage something it 
has no right to do the lawyer said 
so what our ships were doing there was exercising that right 
of innocent passage schiff said he noted that soviet 
intelligencegathering ships routinely operate within five miles of 
the us coastline 
according to the pentagon fridays incident began with the 
yorktown and caron steaming eastward parallel to each other and 
about three miles apart past the crimean peninsula the caron was 
about seven miles off the shoreline and the yorktown about 10 
the two ships had been shadowed by three soviet vessels and 
soviet reconnaissance aircraft ever since entering the black sea 
through the turkish straits on wednesday 
at about 11 am local time friday or 3 am est flynn said 
the soviets broadcast the following warning to the us ships 
soviet ships have orders to prevent violation of territorial 
waters i am authorized to strike your ship with one of ours 
the caron responded i am engaged in innocent passage 
consistent with international law 
when neither the caron or yorktown changed course a 
krivakclass frigate moved up on the yorktown and a mirkaclass 
patrol vessel moved on the caron grazing the left sides of the 
each flynn said 
american naval forays into the black sea each of which must be 
approved by the president are normally ordered at least once a 
year for two reasons said pentagon officials who asked not to be 
named 
the navy ships are expected to monitor soviet military 
operations frequently employing electronic listening gear and to 
assert the right of us warships to navigate through those waters 
the soviet union considers the black sea as its own lake 
even though it is only one of several nations bordering the seas 
waters and maintains a large naval fleet there 
according to boone undersecretary of state michael armacost 
called in soviet ambassador yuri dubinin friday morning to lodge 
a strong protest 
defense secretary frank c carlucci who is scheduled to meet 
with his soviet counterpart next month also intends to protest the 
russian action boone said

the kremlin accused the us state department on 
friday of spreading malicious slanders about human rights in 
the soviet union and said the united states has violations of its 
own 
the official news agency tass carried an interview with alexei 
glukhov of the foreign ministry in which he discussed the state 
departments annual report on human rights around the world 
the report released wednesday in washington said the soviet 
government gave its people greater freedom and showed more 
tolerance toward dissenters in 1987 but it said an allpowerful 
secret police force remained unchecked 
tass said the report again contains malicious slanders against 
the socialist countries including the ussr 
glukhov first deputy head of the foreign ministrys directorate 
for humanitarian and cultural issues accused the state department 
of making the allegations to speed up ratification of the 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons treaty which is making its way 
through the senate 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed 
the treaty in december 
the soviet union glukhov noted conducted a prison amnesty and 
introduced new rules on emigration and immigration last year the 
state department ignored these steps and relied on faulty 
information for its report he charged 
much of the specific information contained in that report is 
clearly drawn from unclean sources he said citing what he said 
was an exaggerated figure of 400 political prisoners in the ussr 
obviously the us state department again lacks simple 
objectivity and simple truthfulness in the evaluations he said 
the soviet union would like to know why the united states has 
political prisoners sentences minors to death and prosecutes 
clergymen for antiwar activities glukhov said 
the us side is far from the measure of openness and 
selfcriticism demonstrated by the soviet union on that issue he 
said referring to human rights 
secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze are to discuss human rights at a meeting in 
moscow on feb 2123

week in geneva are making progress toward means of verifying two 
unratified test ban treaties the white house said friday 
in a statement spokesman marlin fitzwater said the talks which 
begin again monday represent a practical approach as the 
president has long advocated to nuclear testing limitations which 
are in our national security interest 
fitzwater said the united states and the soviet union agreed in 
undertaking the talks that the first step should be to negotiate 
effective verification measures for the threshold test ban treaty 
and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty 
the two pacts limiting the magnitude of certain nuclear tests 
were negotiated in the 1970s but ratification has been withheld 
because of concerns about how soviet compliance could be verified 
once our verification concerns have been satisfied and the 
treaties ratified we will propose that the united states and the 
soviet union immediately enter into negotiations on ways to 
implement a stepbystep program in association with a program to 
reduce and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons of limiting and 
ultimately ending nuclear testing the spokesman said 
we are making progress toward our goal of effective 
verification he added 
with a better understanding of the practical problems 
associated with conducting these experiments we now have the 
information needed to design the experiments fitzwater said 
the two sides have agreed to begin this work immediately upon 
resumption of negotiations on monday we hope that the sides will 
continue to make expeditious progress in these talks 
the statement was released as president reagan arrived in 
california for a fiveday stay

and then killed a policeman during a chase was shot 13 times by 
officers after his escape was blocked by a television stations 
helicopter authorities say 
police also said the man phillip hutchinson 24 of arlington 
va had listed his goals for february and at the top of the list 
was penciled get money 
hutchinson robbed the credit union tuesday and during the 
ensuing police chase he ran over and killed detective robert 
wallis 51 
after running into a tree he took john laurienti hostage and 
forced him to drive him in his pickup truck a kcnctv helicopter 
piloted by mike silva followed hutchinson and blocked his escape in 
a parking lot and officers shot him to death in the truck cab 
laurienti escaped injury except for a cut from flying glass 
the chase and the final confrontation were videotaped by a 
cameraman riding with silva 
adams county sheriffs sgt fred stoll said that because of the 
many entrance and exit wounds on hutchinsons body investigators 
had difficulty telling how many times he had been shot

a long criminal record including escape robbery forgery and the 
ransom kidnapping of a 13yearold boy who escaped unharmed

sentence for aggravated robbery and other charges hutchinson 
hotwired a truck and drove it through a prison fence he had 
eluded authorities since then 
stoll said police found the list of goals among piles of papers 
in hutchinsons mountain home near bailey 
he was known to write detailed strategies and contingency plans 
in advance of his crimes but investigators have not found plans 
for tuesdays credit union office robbery which netted 3000 
meanwhile laurienti 73 was given a new truck friday to 
replace the one damaged in the gun battle 
the truck was purchased for him by a dealership and kcnctv 
laurienti had refused to obey hutchinsons order to ram the 
stations helicopter after silva landed in front of them 
laurienti embraced silva when they met for the first time 
friday and they discussed tuesdays ordeal 
god bless this guy laurienti said he hutchinson could 
have blew my brains out but i wasnt going to ram this guy

sen bob doles presidential campaign is 
wasting no time in trying to lure national convention delegates 
away from vice president george bush even though only a handful 
have been chosen so far 
doles pennsylvania campaign has gone to work on at least some 
of the 18 delegates who were chosen there last week by the 
republican state committee and so far one delegate has been 
enticed to defect while another is complaining of being harassed 
theyre after me grace jesberger said friday in a telephone 
interview from from ridgway pa im just getting a little miffed 
that people are trying to pressure me 
the effort has intensified since bushs thirdplace finish in 
the iowa caucuses but francis shane who leads doles pennsylvania 
campaign said nobodys trying to twist arms 
since iowa were getting calls from people rethinking their 
positions he said 
dole spokeswoman katie boyle said jesberger had been persuaded 
to switch support to the senate minority leader but jesberger 
herself said thats not true 
jesberger said she has often indicated that she has no 
problems with dole but she said she was sticking with bush at 
least for now because he is the best qualified candidate 
however doles campaign did succeed in winning over ronald 
reese an insurance adjuster from philadelphia who was a member of 
bushs state steering committee 
reese did not return calls to his office or home friday but he 
told the pittsburgh press that he left the bush campaign in part 
because it was not paying enough attention to black republicans

evangelist pat robertson 8 and another 8 remain uncommitted there

geraldine ferraro whose vice presidential 
nomination marked a peak for the womens equality movement said 
friday that women must translate their increasing power at the 
ballot box to campaigns for elective office 
if you dont run you cant win ms ferraro said and 
just as important every time a woman runs women win 
ms ferraro addressed some 1500 women attending a symposium on 
women and the constitution convened by former first ladies rosalynn 
carter and lady bird johnson 
she said there are more female officeholders than ever but the 
numbers are not representative of the population 
women are by any measure grossly underrepresented in 
elective office ms ferraro said i would say shockingly 
underrepresented however nobody is shocked thats simply how it 
is 
coretta scott king wife of slain civil rights leader martin 
luther king jr echoed ms ferraro in urging women particularly 
black women to seek office 
we have a strength and tenacity and a gift for nurturing and 
compassion which has been finely honed and tempered in our struggle 
to raise families in a sexist society mrs king said on the 
closing day of the twoday symposium 
let me put it this way if the women of america dont lead 
the struggle against poverty racism and militarism then we must 
ask who will she said 
according to the national womens political caucus in 1987 
women held 14 percent of the higher statewide elective offices in 
the country at the same time there are only 23 women serving in 
the house and only one black woman two female governors and two 
women in the senate 
ms ferraro a former congresswoman from new york said many of 
those officeholders are not yet in positions of national power or 
leadership which she said would likely delay nomination of a woman 
as a presidential candidate 
however more women will become interested in politics and the 
numbers elected will increase she said ms ferraro said her 1984 
campaign with democratic presidential nominee walter mondale 
inspired thousands of women to write her and describe how the 
candidacy inspired them to go to law school medical school or run 
for office 
every time a woman runs for any elective office its like 
throwing a stone in a lake she said the ripple effect is felt 
far beyond the immediate point of impact 
mrs king compared the challenge facing women in the workplace 
and in politics to that faced by blacks during the civil rights 
struggle led by her late husband she said women can learn much 
from the tactics used by blacks to gain rights 
the movement showed millions of americans that you can indeed 
you must defy authority when that authority is in the wrong 
mrs king said 
women have become a distinct and powerful voting group in recent 
years ms ferraro said pointing to the 1986 midterm elections 
that brought a democratic majority to the senate she said nine 
democrats won by getting less than 50 percent of the male vote and 
more than 50 percent of the female vote 
women voted more strongly democratic and on key issues like 
peace disarmament social welfare and the environment differently 
from men she said 
ms ferraro said that after she was nominated for vice president 
during the 1984 democratic national convention in san francisco 
the thousands of joyfully weeping women she saw told her that 
equality and a female president are coming 
she will have shown that she possesses the rare combination of 
qualities the american people look for in a president and then it 
will be time and tears will be cried like you wouldnt believe 
she said

democrat albert gore jr campaigning with 
country music star johnny cash on friday cited increased violence 
and suicide among children as he defended his wifes efforts 
against raw music lyrics 
what she has said is parents should be more aware that younger 
and younger children are targets of increasingly brutal and 
explicit material gore said 
cash a country performer for more than 30 years appeared with 
gore at a small rally in the railroad yard of the virginia museum 
of transportation and planned to travel with the democratic 
presidential candidate to new hampshire but snow in new england 
forced gore and cash to abandon those plans and return to 
washington to await better weather 
gore who has campaigned less in new hampshire than most of his 
rivals while concentrating on the southern primaries hoped to make 
it to that state before saturdays democratic debate 
cash wearing his trademark blackonly attire enthusiastically 
endorsed gore and said his fellow tennesseean was the only 
presidential candidate he has ever publicly backed 
you know the soviet union has a strong energetic man cash 
told about 150 people who stood in subfreezing temperatures 
what we need is a strong energetic young brilliant man and 
thats what we have in al gore 
cashs presence prompted numerous questions at a later news 
conference about gores wife tippers work against sexual and 
violent lyrics in rock music 
gore responded by saying there were epidemics of teen pregnancy 
and suicide and an epidemic of violence by children against 
children 
in the face of that i think its legitimate to ask what is 
the effect of children seeing 18000 murders on television by the 
time they graduate from high school what is the effect of 
increasingly explicit material on younger and younger children 
gore said 
im very proud of what she has done 
he said she has never sought to impose censorship but favors 
voluntary efforts aimed at letting parents know what is contained 
in the music their children listen to 
tipper gores wellpublicized efforts in that cause have brought 
criticism from some in the entertainment industry but gores poll 
takers and strategists say they find little opposition to his 
candidacy in the south or elsewhere based on his wife 
cash said he saw no point in trying to censor what his child 
might hear in music but added i really dont think that tipper 
gore is advocating that kind of censorship anyway 
mrs gore did not accompany her husband but two of their 
children albert jr age 5 and karenna 14 traveled with him 
as gore and cash spoke norfolk southern freight trains rolled 
by noisily just a short distance away prompting gore to call on 
cash to sing a train song cash a country music performer for 
more than three decades complied 
virginias attorney general mary sue terry who is expected to 
run for governor next year appeared with gore as did the 
districts democratic congressman jim olin and the citys 
republican mayor noel taylor 
gore blasted president reagan for a lack of leadership on the 
deficit and the economy he said that after the stock market drop 
last october reagan had nothing of substance to say 
the president came out of the white house and said what 
the helicopter engines were going you know he said they tell me 
ive got to go gore said well hes got a point there 
gore pinning his presidential hopes on the southern primaries 
on march 8 contended that massachusetts gov michael dukakis is 
unlikely to gain great momentum out of an expected win in new 
hampshire before the campaign turns south 
its essentially a twoperson race in most of the south he 
said referring to himself and jesse jackson

send pieces of the bodies to jordan authorities said friday 
dr saud tarawneh 46 a gynecologist who became a us citizen 
in 1980 and his wife ghada 44 were arrested thursday on a 
broward county warrant in toledo ohio where they have lived for 
several years bond for them was set friday at 12 million 
according to mike breece an investigator with the florida 
department of law enforcement the couple allegedly tried to 
arrange the killings to erase the embarrassment from rhana 
tarawnehs elopement with her syrian cousin in 1984 
this would not only help them save face but elevate the 
standing of the family in the tribe to an even higher level than it 
was before the daughter ran away breece said 
the lovers fled from jordan and eventually moved to broward 
county 
police were contacted by a private investigator the tarawnehs 
allegedly asked either to commit the murders himself or arrange for 
a hitman 
tarawneh and his wife were each charged with three counts of 
conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder and three counts of 
solicitation to commit firstdegree murder 
the alleged intended targets were their unwanted soninlaw 
mouataz abdulsamad 29 his younger sister azza and his mother 
najwa 45 
when rhana first fled jordan with her new husband the family 
wanted to send her back and sell her into a prostitution ring 
authorities said 
but as the embarrassment to the family grew deeper the parents 
allegedly tried to set up the killings of her new husband and his 
relatives 
the plans included instructions for the killer to to hang all 
three people take photographs of the bodies then cut the mothers 
tongue out and sexually mutilate the husband and his sister breece 
said instructions were also included on packaging the body parts 
in formaldehyde for shipment to jordan 
breece would not disclose the amount the couple allegedly agreed 
to pay for the murders 
an investigator the parents allegedly tried to hire in early 
january told authorities about the plot and agreed to cooperate 
with the state in its criminal investigation breece said 
after getting court permission for wiretaps agents taped phone 
conversations between the investigator and the family breece said 
a state agent and the investigator who acted as a middle man 
for a nonexistent hitman met with the doctor and his wife in 
detroit on feb 2 breece said 
on wednesday the father was told the the murders had been 
committed and to send his money breece said whether or not he 
did send the money i dont know 
toledo municipal court judge robert penn continued the case 
until saturday because the tarawnehs attorney jeffrey goldstein 
was out of town the couple faces extradition to florida breece 
said

promises while he as a governor takes action 
dukakis said he is fit to lead because ive done it because

emory university researchers have fitted monkeys 
with contact lenses in a study that they hope could yield new ways 
to treat babies born with cataracts and other vision disabilities 
the study at the yerkes regional primate research center 
involves a pediatric ophthalmologist a primate behavioral 
psychologist neuroscientists and several dozen monkeys 
in the experiments rhesus monkeys undergo lensremoval surgery 
to simulate the operation performed on a newborn with cataracts 
the cloudiness of the eye lens that often plagues older adults 
such cataract surgery is not new in most cases when a lens is 
removed the patient can be fitted with corrective contact lenses 
or glasses 
but the surgery poses special problems in young children 
because humans are born without fully developed vision systems the 
eyes and the brain must learn to work together if deprived of 
normal visual stimulation such as by cataracts special cells 
needed for vision fail to mature properly 
cataract surgery must be performed in children at a very early 
age even so doctors have had poor results in trying to stimulate 
development despite corrective lenses the best most children have 
achieved has been 2040 vision 
in the experiment the researchers remove a healthy lens from 
one eye of each monkey they fit them with contact lenses made at 
the centers lab and try various treatment to prompt successful 
vision development 
hopefully well be able to relate these results to the human 
child dr ronald boothe the ophthalmologist and behaviorist who 
heads the twoyearold study said in an interview friday 
in both monkeys and man patients with one good eye and one bad 
one will rely on the good eye 
if a childs left to his own devices hell ignore it the 
damaged eye said dr howard eggers a pediatric ophthalmologist 
from new yorks columbia university who is working with the yerkes 
primate researchers we want to force usage of the cataract eye 
to force use of the weaker eye a child can be fitted with a 
patch over the good eye monkeys dont like to wear eye patches so 
the yerkes monkeys are fitted with a black contact lens over their 
good eye 
in either case stimulating proper vision development in the bad 
eye is not as simple as just blocking the good one eggers said if 
worn too little a patch will leave the patient relying on the good 
eye too long and vision in the patched eye will deteriorate 
doctors are unsure how long the patches or black lenses should 
be worn to give each eye the proper visual stimulation eggers 
said we dont know the best method and we obviously cannot 
experiment with children 
to solve the problem yerkes researchers are using different 
lens routines on different monkeys some wear a black contact lens 
all the time some never do and others wear it for different 
intervals 
researchers check the studys remaining 20 monkeys every two 
hours to make sure they havent lost their lenses they have a 
great ability to rub contact lenses out eggers said lost lenses 
are quickly replaced 
researchers test the monkeys vision in part by showing them 
patterns on a video screen and rewarding them with banana pellets 
when they recognize the proper pattern thus proving their vision 
is working 
after the lens trials the monkeys are killed so researchers can 
examine their brains and the development of their optical nerve 
systems boothe said

this the 88 elections should not be about business as usual in 
america our next president should not be a man who offers simply 
more of the same we need a leader who truly reflects the 
mainstream values that made this country great including hard 
work moral convictions and tolerance for the diversity of 
america we should have the experience and the skill that comes 
from a record of having made a difference and our next president 
should understand that good government means competent government 
run by the very best people america can provide 
in my judgment senator robert dole is the candidate best able 
to lead our country into the 90s he has risen from among the 
people through hard work and honest effort he has never forgotten 
that america is above all the adventure of the common man and he 
knows from experience how to make our government work bob dole has 
indeed made a difference 
as a candidate in this campaign only bob dole embodies best my 
understanding of the crucial challenges we face and what we must do 
to meet them he knows and i agree that we must tackle the 
horrendous budget deficit now without resorting to shortterm 
gimmicks or destructive tax increases that would cripple our 
nations economy he knows and i agree that the answer to our 
trade policy must not be selfdefeating protectionism 
he knows and i agree that in dealing with the soviet union we 
must give moscow no choice but restraint and above all it is 
very clear to me that bob dole has the strength of character a 
president must have to deal with mikhail gorbachev 
i am proud to offer my support for bob dole i urge each of my 
supporters and all republicans to vote for bob dole in this crucial 
new hampshire primary and every primary thereafter the party needs 
bob dole so does america 
now finally a word about that unique american institution the 
media every candidate for a high public office undergoes the most 
searching scrutiny from the media they were fair to me i hope you 
feel i was fair to you

a congressional critic of president reagans 
central america policy said friday the white house may have left a 
loophole in a directive barring government officials from aiding 
private fundraising efforts for the nicaraguan contras 
i was disturbed to learn that the white house instructions 
may not apply to all executive branch employees rep david 
bonior dmich the chief deputy house whip wrote in a letter to 
reagan 
white house chief of staff howard h baker jr and national 
security adviser colin l powell on wednesday issued a memorandum 
directing that no administration official should provide 
assistance or encouragement of any kind to such fundraising 
efforts 
but bonior said the memo was addressed only to white house and 
national security council staff members and not to officials of 
the state department pentagon and the cia 
if the white house intentionally excepted the cia defense and 
state departments they are laying the groundwork for another 
irancontra scandal bonior said in a statement 
during last summers congerssional hearings into the irancontra 
arms and money affair activities by white house and state 
department officials to raise money for the contras including 
those of lt col oliver l north became a focus of concern over 
the privatization of us foreign policy 
in the memo baker and powell said no administration official 
should take a position for or against private support for the 
democratic resistance and that officials should discourage 
discussions of the subject at meetings where they are present 
contra leaders have said they were actively seeking private 
monetary support 
meanwhile reagan declined an invitation from congressional 
leaders to participate in the drafting of a package of strictly 
humanitarian aid to the contras to take the place of the 36 
million administration package which included military aid killed 
by the house on feb 4 
house speaker jim wright dtexas and other democratic leaders 
had written reagan on tuesday to ask for his suggestions but 
reagan wrote back thursday that he would not offer ideas but only 
react to any proposal congress might draft 
the outlines of an acceptable package must provide sufficient 
aid to sustain the freedom fighters in order to maintain those 
pressures that have moved the peace process forward reagan wrote 
the statement seemed a clear indication that the administration 
will insist on aid that would keep the rebels active as a fighting 
force 
without immediate action by the congress the freedom fighters 
will become recklessly exposed and may soon have to make 
irreversible decisions about their own future reagan said in the 
letter even as i write this letter we have reliable reports of 
new soviet military shipments to nicaragua 
current us aid for the rebels including authority for the cia 
to make air drops to fighters in the field inside nicaragua ends 
feb 29 
in a speech thursday night to a conservative political group 
reagan vowed that the curtain hasnt fallen on aid to the 
rebels 
were not giving up on those who are fighting for their 
freedom and they arent giving up either reagan said 
asked friday what the administration intends to do white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said if we cant reach an agreement 
with the democrats we will have our own package 
fitzwater said no decision has been made whether an 
administration package would contain military aid adding first 
of all we want to see what the speaker wright produces 
fitzwater said that by the end of february there will be another 
vote in congress on aid either the democratic plan or an 
administration package

an airline passenger with a beef over a 
bunless hamburger threw his plate and eating utensils at a flight 
attendant who was unable to placate him with a first class roll an 
airline official said friday 
matthew wallis 45 of new york city was booked for 
investigation of misdemeanor battery when american airlines flight 
209 from new york landed at 1015 pm thursday at los angeles 
international airport he was freed after posting bail of 500 
wallis was one of 50 people aboard the dc10 who had ordered a 
special meal said steve mcgregor a spokesman for american based 
in fort worth texas 
he had ordered a hamburger for some reason the hamburger did 
not have a bun with it he became somewhat unhappy with that fact 
our people notified the lead flight attendant who did obtain a roll 
from the first class section thinking that might placate him it 
did not mcgregor said 
wallis wife who flew with him on the new york to los angeles 
flight ordered the same special meal mcgregor said 
her hamburger in fact did have a bun mcgregor said 
when the proffered roll failed to satisfy wallis chief flight 
attendant sue roen of los angeles advised the captain of the 
problem he told her to read him that portion of the law 
outlining passenger misconduct mcgregor said 
she did but that only appeared to make the passenger angrier 
mcgregor said 
after using profanities he picked up his plate with the knife 
and fork still on it and threw it at her ms roen hitting her 
and narrowly missing a passenger with the flying knife said los 
angeles police sgt joe arreola 
ms roen was uninjured and none of the passengers around wallis 
was hurt arreola said 
wallis was placed under citizens arrest by ms roen after she 
was struck by the plate the captain contacted los angeles 
international airport and asked that police stand by mcgregor said 
interference with a flight crew is a federal offense and we 
always prosecute that will be the case here too mcgregor said 
mcgregor was unsure how many passengers were aboard the flight 
and didnt know what the menu item was for passengers who had made 
no special requests

three eastern european countries have begun 
talks with the boeing and mcdonnell douglas aircraft companies to 
supply longrange passenger planes to replace aging soviet 
equipment in their national airlines deputy secretary of state 
john c whitehead said friday 
whitehead just back from a twoweek trip to four sovietbloc 
countries told reporters my impression is they are very much 
interested in buying us planes its a significant thing 
psychologically i believe eastern european countries flying us 
planes 
he declined to identify the countries that expressed interest 
but another official speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
were poland hungary and romania 
if deals are arranged it would be the first us aircraft sales 
to hungary and poland 
in the early 1970s romania purchased several boeing 707 
passenger jets under a contract arranged at a time when the united 
states was wooing romania in hopes of increasing that countrys 
independence from moscow 
whitehead said that from the state departments viewpoint it 
would be feasible and desirable for the sales but he noted two 
major stumbling blocks 
buying us aircraft would require large expenditures by the 
governments and credits from the us exportimport bank for the 
purchases would not be available whitehead said 
the aircraft companies moreover would be prohibited from 
selling equipment on a list of militaryapplicable goods banned for 
export to communist countries this could limit the type of 
airplanes the countries could buy 
there is some navigational equipment that could not be on the 
planes whitehead said they would have to buy stuff that would 
not be on the embargo list 
whitehead the no 2 official in the state department has 
assumed special responsibility for a us effort to gain influence 
in countries that have been dominated by the soviet union since 
world war ii 
under the policy the united states has offered the nations 
increased trade and better relations in general in return for 
improved human rights performance and the institution of free 
economic policies on his latest trip whitehead visited poland 
romania bulgaria and czechoslovakia 
whitehead said he told romanian leader nicolae ceausescu that 
his country is in danger of losing special trading rights granted 
by congress each year to reward romania for its relatively free 
emigration policies 
the trading rights mostfavorednation status have been 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars to romania in previous years 
but renewal for 1988 has been suspended by congress because the 
ceausescu governments human rights policies are considered 
repressive especially toward religious minorities 
whitehead said he told the romanian leader there was only a 
5050 chance it would be renewed but there was still time 
ceausescu in keeping with previous discussions with us 
officials refused to discuss the human rights issues on grounds 
they were strictly an internal matter whitehead said 
i came home with not much reason to hope there will be 
improvement he said

prime minister yitzhak shamir said friday his 
coalition partner and rival foreign minister shimon peres was 
going behind his back in an effort to sabotage shamirs strategy 
for middle east peace 
his accusation came the day after peres suggested that 
intransigence by shamir thwarted talks with king hussein of jordan 
which the foreign minister said could have averted palestinian 
riots in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
at the center of the argument over peace is an initiative by the 
united states 
israeli officials said secretary of state george p shultz 
telephoned peres and shamir on thursday to say he will visit the 
middle east after his scheduled feb 2123 trip to moscow 
us envoy richard murphy outlined the new american ideas to 
israels coalition government this week 
according to israeli officials the plan calls for an 
international conference possibly in geneva as a means of 
beginning arabisraeli talks by april 
negotiations would focus first on a temporary autonomy plan for 
the 15 million palestinians in the occupied territories talks on 
the final status of the west bank and gaza strip would begin by 
december even if selfgovernment had not begun 
peres immediately endorsed the proposals but shamir said 
clarifications were needed and expressed reservations about the 
rapid timetable and international role shamir leads the rightwing 
likud bloc and peres head the centerleft labor party 
on israel radio thursday the prime minister expressed 
frustration over what called leaks intended to undercut his 
negotiating position 
every expression of cooperation on my part is thrown in my 
face immediately he said i show mr peres a letter and after 
a few hours it is in the hands of all the reporters 
everything he does is in the middle of the night what i do he 
wants to know about so that he can sabotage it 
shamir accused peres of surrendering to arab demands for the 
return of land captured in the 1967 middle east war 
how can you conduct negotiations together when your partner 
runs every day and every minute to the other side and says dont 
listen to what shamir says ill sell it to you cheaper shamir 
declared 
moshe shahal of the labor party rejected shamirs claim that 
peres was overeager to accept the us proposals 
we are not being overeager the prime minister is trying to 
give an excuse for a period of no movement he said 
in a speech to party members thursday night peres indirectly 
accused shamir of blocking an international conference agreed to by 
jordan 
if the negotiations with an international opening had begun in 
april when they could have been started would or would it not 
have spared us the events in the territories peres said 
riots began dec 8 and more than 50 arabs have been killed 
nearly all of them by israelis accurding to un figures 
in an interview with hearst newspapers correspondent john p 
wallach shamir said its not a question of intransigence of a 
refusal to talk about it but i dont want to make the american 
government fail 
if we come today with king hussein and the other arabs and 
try to negotiate about the final status the negotiations will 
explode immediately israel will say we want israeli 
sovereignty the other side will say we want arab sovereignty 
and it is finished it will be over before it starts 
shamir said a fiveyear period was needed between palestinian 
autonomy and talks about a final settlement so confidence and trust 
could be built he said that was the concept in the 1978 camp david 
accords which led to the peace treaty with egypt in march 1979 
israel television said shamir sent a letter to shultz on 
wednesday requesting changes in the us proposal but shultz 
refused 
it said shamir asked the americans to drop the international 
conference extend the autonomy timetable and not to set a date for 
talks about the final status of the occupied territories 
the prime minister also asked the united states to enlist the 
support of other countries for building urban neighborhoods to 
house the gaza strips palestinian refugees repoort said

the fish and wildlife service added 59 species 
to the list of endangered and threatened species last year the 
second highest total ever the service said thursday 
in the previous most active year 1979 68 species were added 
the list now stands at 993 animals and plants of which 513 are 
found only in foreign countries the service said in a yearend 
report 
one species was removed from the list after confirmation of its 
longsuspected extinction the amistad gambusia a small fish 
found in some springs in texas 
another species died out during the year but the paperwork to 
remove it from the list has not been completed spokesman david 
klinger said this was the dusky seaside sparrow whose last 
survivor an elderly male in captivity died in florida 
among other reasons to call it a good year the service noted 
its reestablishment of the red wolf in the wild in north carolina 
the growth of the chesapeake bay bald eagle population from 136 
pairs to 161 successful captive breeding of the blackfooted 
ferret and establishment of a second population of california sea 
otters off the coast near los angeles 
too late to make the report was the successful mating of condors 
in captivity in california the service removed the last condor 
from the wild last year on easter sunday and hopes to rebuild the 
population through breeding in captivity 
environmentalists have complained that under the reagan 
administration the service has been moving far too slowly in 
making decisions and that it will take 16 years or so to work 
through the backlog of about 1000 candidate species 
they have said that in the last 20 years 300 species became 
extinct while waiting for a decision 
listing of a species as threatened or endangered under the 1973 
endangered species act means federal agencies must consult the 
service about any of their activities which could harm it also 
the service must draft and try to carry out a recovery plan of 
which 222 are in effect

a research satellite launched last week to 
test elements of the proposed star wars antimissile shield 
failed in a secondary tracking excercise when an optical sensor 
gave false data to two onboard computers an air force official 
said friday 
air force col john otten assistant director of the strategic 
defense initiatives kinetic energy office said an optical sensor 
on delta 181 a satellite used to test star wars sensors and 
trackers gave flawed data when it tried to track target objects 
that were beyond its range 
otten said the sensor data went into the computers causing them 
to respond inappropriately he said the flaw was detected within an 
hour and the computers were told to ignore the data this corrected 
the problem 
some of the test data on the system was lost because of the 
problem but otten said the loss was minor because the tracking 
exercise was a secondary objective in the fundamental mission we 
suceeded he said 
delta 181 was launched feb 8 from the kennedy space center and 
spent 12 hours conducting a series of tests to gather data needed 
to refine the sdi or star wars antimissile system 
program manager andy green last week called the flight a very 
successful mission 
however aviation week and space technology in a story prepared 
for monday publication said the satellite was unable to complete 
battle management fire control computations 
the magazine blamed the problem on the computers but otten said 
the flaw actually was caused by the optical sensor attempting to 
lock onto an object beyond its range 
sensors on the satellite were used to track 14 subsatellite 
targets released in two groups from the delta 
otten said the problem developed when the optical sensor located 
an object looked away and then tried to relocate the original 
object by then the target had moved beyond the range of the 
sensor 
the tracking test using the optical sensor was halted when the 
fuel budgeted for that exercise became exhausted otten said 
he said an infrared sensor also failed to function properly but 
infrared data was collected by a backup system 
otten said only about three percent of the data collected during 
the 12hour mission of delta 181 has been examined

the marine corps and the state department on 
friday minimized a report that more than 500 instances of possible 
wrongdoing by marine guards at embassies worldwide had not been 
investigated properly 
many of the socalled infractions were very minor such as 
curfew violations insubordination and misuse of telephone that 
could have no conceivable tie to suspected kgb activity the 
corps said in a statement the kgb is the soviet spy agency 
both agencies responded to rep dan micas statement that more 
than 500 reports of infractions by marines at embassies had 
remained in the state departments files until recently 
mica dfla said the reports which dealt with black market 
activities or fraternization with soviets are supposed to be 
turned over to the naval investigative service for further 
investigation 
mica said his information came from the general accounting 
office the congressional watchdog agency which began looking into 
security at the embassies in the wake of allegations of espionage 
at the moscow embassy 
the kgb often encourages people to engage in illegal behavior as 
a first step to gaining cooperation with the soviets mica said 
a state department official speaking on condition he remain 
anonymous said the decision to turn over information about a 
possible violation by a marine guard is sometimes made by the 
marines sometimes by the department 
there have been instances where one or both passed along 
information to the nis the official said the removal of a marine 
is also a joint decision he said 
asked about the 578 reports referred to by mica the corps said 
the report is actually a listing of the marine security guards 
whose tours of duty as embassy guards were cut short for a variety 
of reasons during the period 19801987 
some marines were removed for disciplinary reasons others for 
medical reasons or for giving a substandard performance the 
statement said 
of the security guards sent home between 19851987 only a 
handful could be said to relate to espionage during that period 
only one marine sgt clayton lonetree has been convicted of 
espionage for his activities in moscow 
the marines said they had not known about the list of 578 until 
june 1987 when it surfaced at the department of state 
mica was not available to comment because he is in florida 
preparing to announce his candidacy for us senate but his 
spokesman john gersuk said infractions on the list could have 
been things other than black marketeering or fraternization 
violations 
mica has said the various agencies procedures for handling 
potential security problems are chaotic and may need to be 
overhauled

iraq said friday its air defenses shot 
down an unmanned israeli surveillance plane over iraqi territory 
near the border with saudi arabia 
in israel the military command said it had no information about 
such an incident and an army spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said i believe we will not have any information 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in cyprus quoted a 
military statement as saying the remotecontrolled aircraft was 
launched by the zionists to jam iraqi air defenses and monitor 
data for the hireling ayatollah ruhollah khomeini regime 
iraq and iraq are locked in a 7yearold war and often accuse 
each other of receiving israeli aid 
iraq said its air defenses destroyed the craft at 544 pm 
thursday near al maaniyah a small outpost 185 miles southwest of 
baghdad on the saudiiraqi border it said the plane was launched 
from the occupied arab territories a reference to israel and 
israelioccupied territories 
the agency gave no further details it did not say what weapons 
were used to down the plane 
in israel a senior military source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said i think this report is rubbish he expressed 
doubt that an israeli drone could reach iraqi territory it would 
have to fly about 430 miles to get to al maaniyah 
the report was believed to be the first of an israeli intrusion 
into iraqi air space since israeli jets destroyed an uncompleted 
iraqi nuclear power station in 1981 
israel has pioneered development of radiocontrolled 
reconnaissance craft but these have usually been used on 
relatively short missions the israelimade pioneer unmanned 
surveillance aircraft has a range of 115 miles two other 
israelimade drones the scout and the mastiff have a range of 62 
miles and 84 miles respectively 
the craft look like oversized model airplanes they carry 
cameras sometimes including tv cameras that help their distant 
pilots steer the craft to their objectives 
the united states has been testing unmanned surveillance craft 
in the persian gulf

gov tommy g thompson ordered attorneys 
friday to go ahead with a lawsuit against chrysler corp but held 
out hope for a settlement that would preserve jobs at the kenosha 
plant the automaker wants to close 
thompson said chrysler does not want a breach of contract suit 
to be filed over its plan to lay off 5500 auto workers at the 
plant in kenosha which it acquired when it bought american motors 
corp last year and has expressed a willingness to negotiate with 
the state 
it would be better for both parties to settle this case 
quickly thompson said at a news conference 
thompson said chrysler chairman lee iacocca telephoned him 
tuesday and that a meeting was likely soon between state and 
company oficials he declined to say where or when it would be held 
chrysler announced jan 27 it would halt production of the 
omnihorizon autos sept 30 
attorney general don hanaway had advised the governor earlier 
that the state had a clearly enforceable agreement with 
chrysler calling for omnihorizon autos to be built in kenosha for 
five years 
at a news conference in new york last week iacocca defended his 
companys decision to close the aging kenosha plantwe did not 
lie to anybody he said why would we 
hanaway said the state has a good faith basis for filing the 
suit and even though no contract with chrysler was signed i 
dont consider this to be frivolous in any way he said 
in chicago chrysler motors chairman gerald greenwald said 
company officials were sorry the kenosha plant had to be closed 
i guess you could say chrysler was overly optimistic when it 
told workers and government officials in wisconsin that it believed 
it could build the omnihorizon small car at kenosha for up to five 
years greenwald said 
but we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no 
grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie he said we never 
made any hard commitments 
greenwald said chrysler always said market conditions would 
dictate the future of the plant 
greenwald said chrysler would repay the city and county of 
kenosha more than 1 million the governments spent on improvements 
for the plant 
during greenwalds news conference about 50 wisconsin 
autoworkers picketed for hours in icy slush and 10degree weather 
outside his hotel to protest the kenosha closing 
outside workers carried signs bearing slogans such as 1st in 
quality 1st to close work hard get worked over and lee 
is a liar referring to chrysler chairman lee iacocca who 
appears in television ads asking customers to trust chrysler

thirtytwo senators have written to kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev asking him not to interfere with 
demonstrations and religious services scheduled this sunday and 
tuesday in the soviet republics of lithuania and estonia it was 
announced friday 
the senators wrote gorbachev to urge you not only to allow the 
lithuanian and estonian people to peacefully honor their national 
independence days but also to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that they do not become targets of statesponsored 
harassment before or after these commemorations 
the statecontrolled soviet news media has criticized similar 
congressional statements in the past for inciting public 
demonstrations in the baltic republics 
the latest congressional letter cosponsored by sens donald 
riegle dmich david durenberger rminn and frank lautenberg 
dnj praised gorbachev for not interfering with demonstrations 
by an estimated 10000 people in the three baltic republics last 
aug 23 
those demonstrations marked the anniversary of the 1939 
molotovribbentrop pact under which stalin agreed to allow hitler 
to invade western poland and hitler allowed stalin to invade 
eastern poland lithuania latvia and estonia 
for years the citizens of estonia and lithuania have 
celebrated within the privacy of their homes their presoviet 
independence days in february 
the public demonstrations in the baltic republics last august 
came in response to gorbachevs policies of greater openness and 
brought warnings from two conservative members of the ruling 
politburo viktor chebrikov chairman of the kgb security police 
and yegor ligachev the communist partys chief ideologist that 
things were getting out of hand 
the us senators wrote gorbachev that they had received reports 
from emigre groups that 200 lithuanians have written a letter 
informing you of their intention to commemorate their independence 
day on feb 16 with flowerlaying ceremonies 
religious services also have been scheduled sunday to mark the 
presoviet national day in lithuania which remains overwhelmingly 
roman catholic after nearly 50 years of rule by the officially 
atheistic kremlin authorities 
the senators said one report reaching the west indicates that 
soviet authorities may move to block these peaceful ceremonies 
they cited a report of the beating in vilnius on feb 6 of nijole 
sadunaite a leading lithuanian dissident in an apparent attempt 
to intimidate her 
the lithuanian information center an emigre organization with 
offices in washington and new york blamed the beating on 
plainclothes kgb officers 
the letter cited concern over official harassment and abuse 
against demonstrators and cited as an ominous warning a report in 
the communist party daily pravda on jan 29 that lithuanian 
authorities had decided to intensify their efforts against 
bourgeois nationalsim and clerical extremism 
the senators signing the letter besides riegle lautenberg and 
durenberger were brock adams dwash rudy boschwitz rminn

democratic presidential hopeful bruce 
babbitts environmental record won him the gold star in a report 
card issued friday by a national environmental watchdog group 
the league of conservation voters praised babbitt and republican 
presidential hopeful pete du pont for their stands on the 
environment while criticizing several other candidates notably 
rep jack kemp 
the report gave the former arizona governor high marks for his 
stands on air pollution acid rain land management and knowledge 
of worldwide problems such as depletion of the ozone layer and rain 
forests 
also scoring well among the democrats were tennesee sen albert 
gore and illinois sen paul simon with missouri rep richard 
gephardt getting the most lukewarm reception for votes on water and 
population issues 
among republicans du ponts record in congress on water 
pollution toxic waste cleanup and population issues won him the 
leagues highest score 
league chairman brent blackwelder slammed several republicans 
particularly kemp and vice president george bush for their records 
and unwillingness to respond to questionnaires about their 
environmental views 
kemps record has gotten markedly worse in our last two 
charts and the 50 percent grade we gave bush is probably better 
than some of his recent statements might suggest blackwelder 
said

a psychiatrist may be barred from conducting 
federally sanctioned drug testing because of alleged inaccuracies 
he published regarding an experimental treatment for alzheimers 
disease 
dr william k summers of arcadia calif received the warning 
last month in a letter from the food and drug administration that 
involved his account of preliminary studies on 
tetrahydroaminocrydine or tha for combating the degenerative 
mental illness 
after the new england journal of medicine published summers 
paper in november 1986 a public outcry arose for wider testing of 
the drug which summers said was very promising 
the fda subsequently approved such broader testing only to 
suspend it late last year because of an unanticipated number of 
side effects the test procedures were redrawn and clinical trials 
allowed to resume last month 
summers submitted his findings on the alzheimers drug to the 
fda five days after their publication in the new england journal 
the fda letter to summers noted that the journal article was 
submitted as part of his official report to the fda and said 
there are numerous statements in your nejm article that appear to 
be false 
we believe that you have repeatedly or deliberately violated 
regulations pertaining to the proper conduct of clinical testing of 
investigational drugs said the letter from dr frances o 
kelsey director of an fda division that oversees compliance with 
agency research procedures it said he may be barred from 
performing sanctioned tests in the future 
the letter asked summers to explain 14 specific instances where 
the fda found evidence of misinformation it said those are not a 
comprehensive compilation of findings but represent the more 
significant regulatory violations that remain unexplained 
one of the 14 charges said summers failed to report that eight 
patients in his study also were taking other drugs that could 
affect mental functioning along with tha 
another said he failed to report that 10 of the 12 patients in 
one phase of his study lived more than 2000 miles from his office 
and that medical monitoring was erratic and conducted mainly 
through telephone contacts and letters with either family members 
who had a variety of perceptions or local physicians who you 
concede often did not follow your research protocol 
a third charge questioned what the fda said is summers 
subsequent acknowledgement that some of the study statistics he 
submitted were reconstructed from memory 
it does not seem plausible that you precisely remembered 
multiple observations of the entire patient population without a 
written record the agency said 
summers relayed word through his answering service friday that 
he was not accepting telephone inquires about the subject he has 
several informal and formal procedures available to him to defend 
his testing practices to the fda 
the fda letter was disclosed initially in a story in fridays 
new york times 
the fda has not released the letter but the associated press 
obtained a copy from another government source that source who 
asked to remain anonymous said summers has replied in writing to 
the fda but declined to release a copy of the response

paul gillmor president of the ohio 
senate announced his candidacy for congress on friday and 
suggested that his republican opponents withdraw to avoid a 
divisive 5th district primary 
gillmor 49 who earlier was considered a likely candidate for 
governor in 1990 decided to enter the race after veteran 
republican rep delbert latta announced his retirement late last 
month 
latta 67 who has served the sprawling 12county district in 
northwestern ohio since 1957 has said that he will support his 
son robert a 32yearold bowling green attorney who also has 
announced for the nomination 
gillmore told about a dozen supporters here that the best way to 
avoid a bruising primary fight would be for the candidate who has 
the least experience and who is not as well qualified as the other 
candidate to drop out 
i dont expect that to happen he added 
fremont businessman rex damschroder son of former state rep 
gene damschroder also has filed nominating petitions as a 
republican so far no democrat has filed petitions in advance of 
the feb 18 deadline

a convicted ira bomber serving a life 
sentence married his american sweetheart friday in a simple 
ceremony in the prison chapel 
paul hill 33 has been imprisoned for 14 years for bombings 
that killed seven people in england and injured 85 he says he is 
innocent and is hoping his conviction will be overturned by a new 
police inquiry 
hill was allowed to chat briefly with his bride marion 
severelli of new jersey after the short ceremony conducted by a 
roman catholic chaplain at long lartin jail 110 miles northwest of 
london 
he was then returned to his cell but he was allowed to 
celebrate with his bride and about 15 guests at a brief reception 
later during which the couple cut a wedding cake 
a prison spokesman said no alcohol was served and the couple 
remained under the watchful eye of prison officers 
ms severelli a buyer for a paper mill first wrote to hill 
three years ago with news that a friend of his had died after a 
year of writing she flew to britain to meet him 
when i first saw him he was just about everything i thought 
he would be gentle and feeling she said he is not at all 
cynical even though he is not guilty and has been locked up for 
almost 14 years 
ms severelli said she is convinced her husband is innocent and 
hopes he will be able to join her in the united states if he is 
ever released 
she did not give her age or hometown and the information was not 
immediately available from prison officials 
bombs exploded in october 1974 in two pubs in the town of 
guildford near london killing four soldiers and a civilian and 
injuring about 50 other people the following month a bomb blew up 
in a pub in the london district of woolwich killing two people and 
injuring 35 others all three pubs were frequented by military 
personnel 
responsibility for the bombings was claimed by the irish 
republican army the group is fighting to end british rule in 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite the province with 
the overwhelmingly roman catholic irish republic 
hill was one of four people convicted of the pub bombings the 
socalled guildford four have always maintained their innocence 
last july home secretary douglas hurd ordered a police inquiry 
into the bombings after receiving statements from a delegation led 
by cardinal basil hume head of the roman catholic church in 
england and wales that expressed concern about the verdicts 
ms severelli said she and her husband had discussed the 
possibility that he might spend the rest of his life in jail but 
they decided last spring to get married anyway 
i dont know if he will get justice in a british court but i 
believe that good will triumph she was quoted as telling the 
guardian newspaper on friday 
ms severelli has been staying at the evesham prison visitor 
center to meet the residential qualification for the wedding she 
is expected to return to the united states next week

the environmental protection agency said 
friday it had begun a special review of the insecticide dichlorvos 
which is used in flykilling pest strips and many other 
applications 
the agency said studies on laboratory animals show the chemical 
may cause cancer and liver damage 
some 2 million pounds of dichlorvos are used in about 800 
products every year about 25 percent is used on farm crops 35 
percent on livestock 25 percent in commercial and industrial 
buildings and on lawns and ornamental crops and 15 percent in 
homes and on pets epa said 
dichlorvos has been used since 1948 against flies mosquitoes 
gnats cockroaches and other insects 
last septmeber the agency ordered new label warnings and 
restrictions on commercial use of most products to statecertified 
applicators but did not restrict home and pet products workers 
are supposed to keep out of commercial and agricultural areas for 
48 hours after treatment 
epas special reviews can lead to fewer or more restrictions a 
ban on the product or its exoneration the agency tries to complete 
the reviews in 12 months to 15 months

angola has rejected a south african 
proposal for a regional peace conference that would include angolan 
rebels angolas official angop news agency reported friday 
it quoted a government statement as saying angola was prepared 
to hold direct peace talks with south africa if that country 
rejected the united states as a mediator 
but the marxist government rejected any negotiations that would 
include rebels of the national union for the total independence of 
angola unita according to the report monitored in lisbon 
it quoted the statement as saying the reference to the 
participation of unita removes all credibility from the south 
african governments proposal 
it also claimed the proposal was a maneuver aimed at gaining 
time to increase south african military pressure on government 
forces in southern angola 
president pw botha of south africa said last month he was 
willing to participate in a regional meeting to resolve conflicts 
in southern africa and that unita should be represented 
botha has not specifically proposed a peace conference or put 
forward any concrete suggestions 
anticommunist unita guerrillas have been battling the 
government since the marxists gained power following angolas 
independence from portugal in 1975 
the rebels are backed by south africa and receive aid from the 
united states an estimated 40000 cuban military personnel and 
soviet advisers are helping the government forces 
south african troops have made frequent incursions into southern 
angola from neighboring southwest africa also known as namibia 
angola in its statement that rejected any talks with unita 
said it would be coherent and logical to include in a regional 
conference the southwest african peoples organization swapo and 
the african national congress 
the african national congress is the main rebel movement 
fighting south africas whiteled government and swapo is a black 
guerrilla group fighting for independence for namibia which is 
administered by south africa 
angop quoted the angolan statement as saying the main causes of 
confict in the region are south africas illegal occupation of 
namibia south african attacks against its blackruled neighbors 
and its alleged creation of armed groups to carry out terrorist 
activities in those countrie and the denial of political rights 
to the black majority in south africa 
later friday the angolan embassy in lisbon issued a statement 
denying reports published in portugal that representatives of the 
angolan government and unita would hold peace talks this summer in 
lisbon

said the secretarygeneral on behalf of all the un staff 
members is very pleased about botas return 
bota will retain a directorlevel post but his disarmament job 
has been taken over by another official un spokeswoman therese 
gastaut said 
he was met by his wife sandra and jan martenson director of the 
un office in geneva 
mrs bota has claimed romanian authorities put her husband under 
roundtheclock surveillance following him with two cars and 
tapping or periodically cutting off his telephone 
romanian officials played deaf and dumb insisting that bota 
had no legal ties with the united nations or that his un contract 
was not valid she said in a written statement published in geneva 
last month 
un officials intensified efforts on botas behalf after his 
wife took an overdose of tranquilizers and other pills in may 1986 
perez de cuellar made repeated demands for his release and the 
case also was on the us human rights agenda 
john c whitehead deputy secretary of state met with bota last 
week during a visit to romania state department officials would 
not say whether whitehead had a role in the release 
when he was called home bota had been a un official for 13 
years on loan from his government and had headed the disarmament 
institute since 1980 
president nicolae ceausescus government later told the united 
nations that bota was resigning his disarmanent post but un 
officials refused to accept the resignation unless it was submitted 
in person 
he was not allowed to do so and the romanian government later 
accused him of espionage 
there have been other cases in which un officials from the 
soviet bloc were detained during visits to their homelands and un 
intervention had no effect 
one of the most publicized cases was that of alicja wesolowska 
a un secretary in new york who was detained on a visit to poland 
she was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1979 on charges of 
spying for a nato nation that was not identified 
percy stultz an east german employe of the parisbased un 
educational scientific and cultural organization was arrested in 
march 1980 while visiting his country and convicted of 
antistate activities 
both ms wesolowska and stultz eventually were freed from 
prison but both have been confined to their contries

the dollar soared in value friday against most 
major currencies around the world after the government reported 
that the us trade deficit shrank for the second consecutive month 
in december 
gold prices rose at republic national bank in new york the 
late bid for the precious metal was 44550 a troy ounce up 5 
from thursday 
weve got the excitement at last said james oneill an 
economist and currency analyst for marine midland bank within 30 
seconds that the trade numbers came out there was an immediate 
adjustment upward 
the commerce department said friday that the nations 
merchandise trade shortfall shrank to 122 billion in december 
from 132 billion in the previous month as exports jumped 42 
percent 
the december gap was the smallest since a 119 billion deficit 
in january 1987 and much lower than market analysts had predicted 
the dollar had risen about two yen and it was up around two 
cents against the british pound and the swiss franc shortly after 
the trade report was released according to oneill 
later in the day though some profittaking and a reluctancy to 
hold dollar positions through the long washingtons birthday 
holiday weekend helped pushed the american currency off its highs 
traders said 
even though the numbers are good nobody wants to go home 
sitting on dollars because all the old fears havent dissipated 
said oneill those fears being that the trade deficit is still 
too big and that the dollar may have to fall further to get rid of 
it 
the dollars protracted decline in value began more than two 
years ago as a result of coordinated efforts by the united states 
and its main trading partners to improve the us trade picture and 
avoid protectionist legislation in in the past several weeks 
however the dollars value has been relatively stable 
gary dorsch senior money market analyst for lns financial group 
inc said the dollar also was helped friday by a rise in interest 
rates in the credit markets he said dealers believe the federal 
reserve wont move to push rates lower in order to prevent the 
dollar from falling 
rising interest rates tend to support a currency because they 
attract foreign investors eager to buy higheryielding us 
securities 
the dollar rose above 130 japanese yen for the first time since 
middecember trading at 13115 yen in london from 12995 earlier 
in tokyo and up from 12903 yen in tokyo on wednesday tokyo 
markets were closed for a national holiday

129265 late thursday

the environmental agency hasnt proven it can 
legally authorize the retail sale of small amounts of the pesticide 
chlordane as part of a deal to ultimately take the antitermite 
chemical off the market a federal judge said friday 
the agencys latest court filing does not satisfy federal law 
which requires the epa to determine that a pesticide will not 
unreasonably harm the environment said us district judge louis 
f oberdorfer 
the epa believes that chlordane causes cancer to avoid a 
protracted battle with 197 distributors the agency has agreed to 
let them sell chlordane already in stock in return the companies 
are argeeing to cancellation of their licenses to sell the 
pesticide 
oberdorfer however said the epa had produced no evidence to 
back its assertion that distribution of remaining stocks wont 
cause undue harm 
the lawyer representing the epa steven rogers argued that 
insisting on the use of the procedures in the law would in the end 
mean less environmental protection in this case because 
distributors could fight the revocation of their licenses and 
continue selling chlordane products during what could become 
protracted hearings 
the judge asked the national coalition against the misuse of 
pesticides to submit a draft order declaring use of remaining 
stocks of chlordane illegal but he gave no indication of when he 
might rule the coalition and others have been seeking such an 
order since october 
it is unclear whether the order will make a difference no one 
knows how much chlordane distributors have though the epa says it 
believes the amount is very small 
the epa concluded last year that excessive chlordane residues 
can remain in a home even after proper application generally 
chlordane is injected under pressure into soil around the 
foundation 
the only manufacturer of chlordane velsicol chemical corp and 
the epa agreed last august that velsicol would no longer sell it 
while the company tries to come up with an acceptable application 
method 
the company and the epa later agreed to end use of velsicols 
inventories but the stocks of companies using chlordane in their 
own products werent covered by the agreement 
after the hearing bob perliss an epa lawyer working with 
rogers said the companies had reported holding a total of about 
1700 pounds this would be 16 percent of the amount in velsicols 
hands in august or a twomonth supply at the thenprevalent usage 
rates

the head of the us delegation to a 
review of the helsinki accords accused moscow and its allies friday 
of hampering progress on a final document by stalling on human 
rights issues 
what we see now is that things are beginning either to level 
off or in some cases to go backward warren zimmermann said at 
the third followup conference on security and cooperation in 
europe 
textual obligations are festooned with loopholes that deprive 
them of all force zimmermann told a plenary meeting referring 
to soviet bloc draft proposals for example freedom of religion 
must be consistent with public safety order health and morals 
other freedoms are limited by national legislation 
zimmermann told a news conference that in the three weeks since 
the meeting resumed after a christmas break he noticed a very 
serious effort by the east bloc to put off an agreement 
i hope its tactical and i hope that it will change he said 
delegates from 35 countries including the united states canada 
and all european nations except albania have been meeting in vienna 
since november 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 helsinki 
accords on military security economic cooperation and humanitarian 
issues 
zimmermann rejected soviet bloc assertions that the west is 
stressing humanitarian concerns at the expense of european 
disarmament issues 
were not holding any element here hostage to any other 
element zimmermann said 
he also said the obstructionist approach of soviet bloc 
governments at the conference has been accompanied by 
disquieting signs of failure of those same governments to 
observe helsinki commitments at home 
zimmermann noted that a soviet promise to release all 
religious prisoners in an amnesty last november was not kept 
and the elimination of psychiatric abuse is still awaited despite 
promises made as recently as yesterday 
he said he noticed similar human rights abuses in other bloc 
countries including romania and czechoslovakia 
the concluding date of the conference has been postponed twice 
before christmas diplomats set the deadline for easter but some 
western dilopmats now say summer would be more realistic 
the accords or the 1975 helsinki final act include commitments 
to honor human rights individual freedoms travel and other 
exchanges among nations the 35 signatory nations promised to honor 
the covenants provisions but the accords have no enforcement 
mechanism

angry tenants and a banner reading welcome you 
reptile greeted a landlord friday when he reported to one of his 
buildings to serve a 15day sentence of house arrest for failing to 
correct housing violations 
morris gross 77 who lives in a luxury highrise in the 
brighton beach section of brooklyn will be confined to a 
fifthfloor apartment in a building where tenants complain of bugs 
and rodents lack of heat and hot water and leaky ceilings 
his movements will be monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet 
to make sure he serves his sentence 
a judge convicted gross of criminal and civil contempt in 
december after the city department of housing preservation and 
development brought action against him for failing to comply with a 
court order to correct housing violations 
he was fined 32000 for the contempt conviction and 137900 in 
civil penalties judge ira harkavy gave him the option of spending 
15 days under house arrest and putting the 137900 toward the cost 
of correcting the 420 violations at the 113unit building in the 
flatbush section of brooklyn 
asked why gross chose house arrest his attorney stanley 
kopilow said gross wanted to show to the judge and the community 
that this is not as bad as portrayed in the press 
gross made no comment to the group of angry tenants who shouted 
at him when he walked into the lobby friday morning the landlord 
whose meals will be catered will have a private security guard 
with him in the apartment during his sentence 
we ask for so many things and they dont do anything said 
tenant errol ramdeo 
he said the door to the apartment where he lives with his 
parents is off its hinges bathroom tiles are falling off the wall 
and their stove doesnt work 
joyce stewart president of the tenants association took a 
group of reporters on a tour to show them some of the violations 
she pointed out a large hole in the ceiling of one apartment from 
which water comes down like crazy 
tenant vivian murray complained of flaking paint chips which 
she has discovered her 2yearold daughter eating 
lawrence carelli the housing agency attorney who handled the 
case said there were still 400 outstanding violations in the 
building some dating back five years 
building superintendent sydney pilgrim said gross had spent 1 
million to repair the building 
we know gross is not an angel we know he should not have let 
the building run down so far but work is getting done pilgrim 
said 
ms stewart charged that cosmetic repairs had been done on only 
10 to 12 apartments when you subtract that from 113 apartments 
youll see the real mccoy she said

the navy acknowledged late friday that due 
to an oversight the remains of a vietnam war victim had been 
transported from hawaii to california this week without informing 
the mans widow 
the navy and pentagon also said they could not explain why a 
request by the widow to withhold public announcement of a military 
laboratorys identification of the remains had not been honored 
the widow erna mckinney of san diego calif said thursday in 
a telephone interview she had asked that the identification be 
withheld because she wanted to obtain a second opinion to verify 
the militarys forensic work 
last tuesday the pentagon announced the armys central 
identification laboratory in honolulu had succeeded in identifying 
six sets of remains repatriated to the united states from vietnam 
one of the six the pentagon said had been identified as navy 
lt clemie mckinney an aviator who was lost over south vietnam on 
april 14 1972 mckinney who was 26 listed his home as cleveland 
ohio at the time of his disappearance 
i told them i didnt want them to release the identification 
because i wasnt prepared to accept the finding that i wanted a 
second opinion said mrs mckinney who contacted reporters after 
news stories about the pentagons announcement appeared 
and then they did it anyway and then theyre bringing in the 
remains and nobody told me 
the remains of mckinney and the other five mias were transported 
from hawaii to travis air force base calif on thursday 
since mckinney was a navy officer navy officials were 
responsible for dealing with his nextofkin 
lt col keith schneider a pentagon spokesman said friday that 
navy casualty assistance officers had earlier informed mrs 
mckinney of the procedures that would be followed for transporting 
the remains 
unfortunately due to an oversight the transportation 
arrangements were not confirmed to her before the public 
announcement schneider said after consulting with navy officials 
the spokesman said he did not know why mrs mckinneys request 
to withhold public announcement of the identification was not 
honored 
all i can say is that we routinely abide by the familys 
desires on that point schneider said if we had been aware of 
that request here at the pentagon we would have made sure the 
identification was not released publicly 
regretably there were misunderstandings or misinterpretations 
in this case and were now working with the family to remedy those 
we will work very closely with the nextofkin to satisfy their 
preferences and desires 
mrs mckinney said she wanted to have the remains moved to 
another forensic scientist in colorado for detailed examination 
im not trying not to accept their identification she said 
im just not ready to accept some of their evidence and thats 
why i didnt want their identification announced yet 
although the work of the armys laboratory has been verified for 
the most part there have been instances in which independent 
scientists concluded the laboratory did not have sufficient 
evidence to justify a finding of positive identification

irelands prime minister said after a 
chilly meeting with margaret thatcher on friday he was not satified 
with the british attitude in a dispute over police conduct in 
northern ireland 
british officials said the 30minute meeting between prime 
minister thatcher and charles haughey of ireland was calm and 
dignified but an irish statement said haughey could not regard 
the present response of the british government in the areas of 
principal concern as satisfactory 
the statement said haughey was still waiting for an adequate 
response to irish protests made at an intergovernmental meeting 
feb 2 
fridays meeting was the first between the two leaders since 
britain acknowledged on jan 25 that there was evidence of a 
coverup after police in the british province killed six unarmed 
roman catholics in three separate incidents in 1982 
britain said there would be no prosecutions there are fears the 
affair could damage the angloirish agreement which is aimed at 
bolstering the catholic minoritys confidence in british justice in 
northern ireland 
mrs thatcher expressed her belief that the angloirish 
agreement must continue as therein lies the future a british 
spokesman said after the meeting referring to the 1985 pact giving 
the irish republic a consultative role in northern ireland affairs 
he spoke on condition of anonymity following government practice 
the killings of five irish nationalist guerrillas and a 
teenager prompted charges that police had a shoottokill policy 
an investigation found no evidence of official shoottokill 
tactics but said officers lied and tried to cover up their 
practices 
at fridays meeting mrs thatcher said the decision not to 
prosecute was not influenced by her administration since it was 
made by the director of public prosecutions who is not a member of 
the government 
it was endorsed and announced however by solicitorgeneral sir 
patrick mayhew a cabinet member he said prosecutions would not 
promote national security or be in the public interest 
mrs thatcher promised haughey that tom king her minister for 
northern ireland would make a statement soon about the 
organizational implications of the affair the british 
spokesman said 
this was interpreted as a suggestion that britain is considering 
changes in the royal ulster constablulary which draws most of its 
personnel from the protestant majority 
king has said disciplinary action could be taken against 
officers involved in the affair 
haughey and mrs thatcher met during an emergency economic 
summit of the 12nation european economic community

rep jack kemp on friday accused pat 
robertsons rival gop presidential campaign of deliberate 
distortions and won a standing ovation from conservatives when 
he lectured the former television evangelist on the need to obey 
the ten commandments 
i cant insist that all candidates abide by ronald reagans 
11th commandment not to speak ill of another republican kemp 
said in an address to the conservative political action committee 
but all of us should abide by the ninth commandment thou 
shalt not bear false witness he said to prolonged cheers 
robertson was scheduled to address the group immediately after 
kemp but bad weather grounded his airplane in new hampshire and 
prevented his appearance 
but his campaign issued a statement calling the congressmans 
charges totally unfounded connie snapp an aide said 
contrary to the charges we have investigated and found that no 
robertson staff member was involved in the distribution of the 
material in question 
in merrimack nh robertson said we didnt put out any of 
this stuff hes talking about its ridiculous what hes 
talking about 
meantime robertson and sen bob dole of kansas staying at the 
same hotel met for 30 minutes friday night asked whether they 
were striking a deal dole said we just had a nice pleasant 
chat and a cup of coffee he feels good about his chances i feel 
good about mine 
when asked if he would want to inherit robertsons supporters if 
robertson is defeated dole responded i said we ought to put out 
the melcome mat these are good people theyre looking for a party 
to join in many cases 
kemps demand that robertson repudiate a television commercial 
being aired by his campaign as well as fliers distributed in early 
primary and caucus states reflected the stakes involved in the 
early stages of the gop presidential campaign kemps bid to emerge 
as a clear conservative alternative to vice president george bush 
and dole has been damaged by robertsons surprising showing in the 
iowa caucuses and in other states making next tuesdays new 
hampshire primary a critical test 
thus while kemp said at a news conference that the republicans 
would be taking a step backward if they nominated either the 
vice president or the kansas senator he saved his sharpest words 
for robertson 
kemp avoided leveling an accusation of dirty tricks personally 
against robertson but said the former ministers campaign was 
guilty of deliberate distortions 
i would like him to call off the flier and the ad he said 
following his speech i would expect a response from pat 
kemps anger was generated by printed material saying he was 
soft on pornography and suggesting that a member of his family had 
had an abortion its a lie mary brunette a kemp aide said 
of the abortion suggestion there is absolutely no truth in it 
whatsoever 
distributed to fundamentalist christian voters in iowa new 
hampshire and minnesota the material purports to reproduce ratings 
of the republican candidates by the biblical scoreboard which is 
published by biblical news service 
jack waldron editor of the news service said the material was 
altered and he described it as a malicious nasty underhanded 
attempt to smear men who are running for president and an obvious 
affront and attack on biblical news service 
the new york congressman also complained about a robertson 
television commercial that cited a study by washington econometrics 
forecasting services saying that robertson had the best economic 
proposal of all the contenders and kemp had one that would bring on 
a depression 
the commercial cites a wall street journal story on the 
forecast but kemp said the newspapers coverage amounted to 
ridicule since it placed the report in a humor section 
in addition the journal printed an editorial on feb 5 
denouncing the use of its story in the television commercial 
kemp in his formal remarks said he had welcomed robertsons

were each sentenced friday to 30 years in prison and 350000 in 
fines 
armando estrada 28 roman rodriguez 31 and arturo de la vega

first trial ended in a hung jury last year 
in all more than 70 of the departments 1033 officers have 
been arrested fired or suspended since the investigation of 
corruption began three years ago 
us district judge kenneth l ryskamp told the three during the 
sentencing hearing that they shamed their entire profession during 
the sentencing hearing 
when i was a boy i thought a police officer must be the 
highest calling but young people today have the perception of a 
police officer as one who is corrupt he said 
miami police chief clarence dickson however said the officers 
arrested do not reflect on the integrity of his department the 
majority of the men and women on the streets are honest upstanding 
cops

three calvin college science 
professors who taught evolution instead of the biblical version of 
creation were sharply criticized in a report released friday by 
trustees of the private college 
but the report which followed a yearlong investigation by a 
study committee called for no sanctions against the professors and 
concluded that their teachings fell within guidelines set by the 
christian reformed church for interpretation of the bible 
the report was very critical in a studied careful pastoral 
way of the professors writings and teachings said the rev 
charles de ridder chairman of the board 
it was supportive of the professors concern for exploring 
theories other than creationism but de ridder said the panel 
reminds the professors of the limitations that the guidelines 
place upon the interpretation of the bible 
the board said those guidelines allow the teachings of such 
theories as evolution but that they ought to be evaluated in 
terms of the christian faith said gordon van harn provost of 
the college 
the study committee was formed in response to dozens of critical 
letters about the professors from students faculty church members 
and others de ridder said 
the professors clarence menninga and davis young of the geology 
department and howard van till of the physics department who have 
a combined 52 years at calvin did not attend the boards news 
conference 
however van till said in a statement that he respected the 
board for recognizing the need for academic freedom and that 
the report contains both criticism and praise and speaks of both 
caution and encouragement 
the committee urges me to refine my interpretative methods in 
such a way that neither the event character nor the revelational 
meaning of biblical history will be called into question he said 
the professors describe themselves as loyal longtime members of 
the 300000member grand rapidsbased christian reformed church 
which owns calvin

alexander m haig jr ended his quixotic 
quest for the presidency friday endorsing kansas sen bob dole and 
attacking vice president george bush as no more than a spectator in 
reagan administration councils 
asked his opinion of bushs involvement in important 
decisionmaking the former secretary of state said bush had merely 
been there period 
more than 200 reporters and at least 30 television cameras were 
in the room for haigs announcement by far the most coverage he 
received at any time in his yearlong campaign he withdrew from 
the race for the republican presidential nomination at a news 
conference on a day when a snowstorm played havoc with the 
schedules of the remaining candidates 
he opened by saying his assessment of the race had made it clear 
that al haig will not be the 1988 republican nominee 
haig received less than 1 percent of the vote in the iowa 
precinct caucuses on monday and was receiving only about 1 percent 
support in polls of republican voters in new hampshire 
he endorsed dole as the candidate who embodies best my 
understanding of the crucial challenges we face 
dole appeared briefly at haigs side to say the endorsement 
means a great deal to me personally and that the former nato 
commander had told him he wanted no role in a dole administration 
while free with his praise of dole haig seemed to relish even 
more his attacks on bush 
what have you got against george bush haig was asked 
not a single thing in terms of george bush he replied 
hes a friend ive known him for 20 years 
but he went on to say that he had worked with both men for two 
decades and from my point of view bob dole is head and shoulders 
above george bush as a potential president 
most important of all he said dole exceeds bush in the 
demeanor the internal strength the ability to deal eyeball to 
eyeball with those who do not share our values around the world 
bush later phoned wkne in keene to boast that he won the 
immediate endorsement of state rep edward bennett of bridgewater 
one of haigs three state cochairman 
then on manchester television bush said bennett thinks that 
im head and shoulders above bob dole 
haigs greatest contribution to the dole campaign may well have 
come earlier during televised debates when he pressed bush on his 
role in the irancontra affair and asked him if he had been in 
the cockpit or on an economy ride in the back of the plane as 
vice president 
when asked friday about reports of bush involvement with 
panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega haig said i do 
think theres been less than forthright discussion of this issue by 
the vice president 
haig withdrew four days before the new hampshire primary and 
when asked about the timing he replied in a sentence typical of 
what had become known during his public career as haigspeak 
it takes a bit of arrogance to be so egoinvolved in a 
campaign such as this that you want to take the few percentage 
points that could be critical to another candidate to the political 
graveyard 
im not that way i want to make a difference 
as a candidate the 63yearold retired general who had 
announced last year he was throwing my helmet into the ring was 
often openly critical of reagan administration domestic and foreign 
policies 
speaking with the authority of having been reagans first 
secretary of state haig has criticized the presidents approach in 
the persian gulf and also has opposed the inf treaty to eliminate 
mediumrange missiles from europe 
on domestic issues he has said the record federal budget 
deficits of the reagan years stemmed in part from the policies 
pursued by the administration making him the only candidate other 
than dole to lay some of the blame somewhere other than on congress 
in campaign appearances haig was fond of saying he had served 
under seven presidents and recalling his strong role as chief of 
staff in the white house during the final months of richard m 
nixons presidency 
at a republican dinner in nashua wednesday night he quipped 
im the only one of the gop candidates whos been president 
before and i liked it

the government accused foreign 
media friday of a disinformation campaign and said a report that 
ethiopian troops killed at least 20 civilians at a drought relief 
camp was unfounded 
fanatics of one calling or another have in recent months tried 
to disrupt the relief distribution efforts and their accomplices 
continue to fabricate such unfounded allegations said the relief 
and rehabilitation commission the government agency responsible 
for drought relief 
this latest unfounded report is just another instance the 
commission said in a statement 
foreign relief sources in ethiopia said thursday that ethiopian 
troops opened fire on thousands of drought victims when civilians 
resisted forced resettlement twenty people were killed and many 
others wounded the sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the sources said the shootings occurred monday at the northern 
town of korem in tigray province 525 miles north of the capital 
addis ababa 
no one in his right mind can imagine that any responsible 
person can commit such an atrocity against drought victims the 
commission said 
the commission said it had stated repeatedly that the 
resettlement program was voluntary 
tigray and its northern neighbor eritrea are the hardest hit 
by a drought that threatens more than 5 million ethiopians with 
starvation drought in the northern regions has been exacerbated by 
a civil war in eritrea 
ethiopias marxist government began the resettlement program in 
november 1984 with a goal of moving 15 million people from the 
overpopulated droughtravaged north to unused fertile land in the 
south and west 
at least 600000 people were resettled before the government 
halted the program in february 1986 amid charges from the west that 
people were being forced to move sometimes at gunpoint critics 
said the governments aim is to depopulate the north which is home 
to two rebel movements 
ethiopia resumed resettlement nov 25 promising the program 
would be voluntary and humane

about 500 people demonstrated outside the 
headquarters of an electric power company in southwestern japan 
friday protesting a test at a nuclear power reactor 
some of the demonstrators had stayed overnight at the site after 
attending a rally thursday that police said drew 1500 people 
the protesters at the headquarters in takamatsu of the shikoku 
elecric power co opposed an output test at the companys nuclear 
reactor at ikata that was conducted friday 
takamatsu is 340 miles southwest of tokyo and ikata is 115 miles 
southwest of takamatsu 
sueaki maekawa a member of a local antinuclear group said 
the protest action was initiated by ordinary people such as 
housewives who have no affiliation with big organizations it is 
really encouraging 
police spokesman yasunori aya said about 300 police officers 
were sent to the demonstration friday to keep order the protesters 
were noisy but not violent and there were no arrests he said 
a shikoku company official said that in the test the reactors 
output was reduced by 50 percent over a period of three hours the 
official speaking with the condition he not be identified said 
the test was made to collect data on rapid reactor output shifts 
dealing with the fluctuating demand for power 
protesters said the test was similar to one conducted at the 
chernobyl nuclear power complex in the soviet union on april 26 
1986 that resulted in a fire and the worlds worst nuclear 
accident the soviets said at least 31 people perished from the 
fire or radiation 
the company official said the tests were different he said the 
soviets tried to stop the turbine completely and the japanese test 
only involved a 50 percent cutback 
he said the soviets also disconnected safety devices at the 
chernobyl plant while the devices at the ikata reactor remained in 
operation 
the kyodo news service quoted soichiro ito directorgeneral of 
science and technology agency as saying there was was no cause for 
concern about the safety of the test

a group of 30 prominent intellectuals 
appealed to communist authorities to respect the right of free 
association but the staterun pap news agency called their 
petition unnecessary 
in a commentary on its englishlanguage service released late 
thursday pap said the appeals postulates seem to be somewhat 
belated like trying to pry open doors which are already open 
it said the signers do not take notice of very important 
changes which have occurred and continue to occur in polands 
sociopolitical life including a relaxation of censorship to 
allow public debates on practically all internal problems 
in december the polish united workers communist party 
approved a package of political reforms that includes a pledge to 
ease curbs on forming independent associations 
however a new law on associations has not been passed yet and 
authorities have blocked efforts to form some independent groups 
such as the economic society a lobbying group favoring private 
enterprise 
the intellectuals petition was submitted to parliament on feb 
1 and was made public this week 
the appeal said it is impossible to start overcoming 
polands crisis without real and not only declarative respect 
for the citizens right to free association it said every 
citizen should have the right to demand changes in the law without 
being punished for doing so 
the signers included 11 full members of the prestigious polish 
academy of science warsaw university rector grzegorz bialkowski 
former solidarity economic adviser ryszard bugaj and the economic 
societys chairman aleksander paszynski

a british group said friday it could not afford to 
buy a secondhand spitfire for a new world war ii museum in france 
more than 20000 of the famous british fighters were built and 
saw service from 19381954 the wartime cost of a spitfire was 
5000 pounds then about 24000 
there arent many spitfires left and when the french asked us 
to try to get one we were told the cost would be 300000 pounds 
522000 or more we couldnt face up to that said lt gen 
sir ian harris 
haris british support committee for the memorial museum of the 
battle of normandy at caen is now trying to raise the equivalent of 
87000 to buy a secondhand typhoon fighterbomber 
its not a bad substitute harris said 
harris 77 was the first british regimental commander to enter 
caen on july 9 1944 he spoke at a news conference to announce his 
committees appeal for a total of 261000 for the museum 
the money will pay for british war relics ranging from a 
churchill tank to a miniature radio transmitter used by 
intelligence agents landed before the invasion of france on june 6 
1944 
its somewhat disconcerting that while it was british troops 
who first entered caen other countries whose forces were never in 
the city are giving the museum substantially more importance and 
support than we are harris said 
he said that in the united states for example 300000 members 
of a normandy society plan to support the museum project 
troops from germany and 11 allied countries fought in the 78day 
battle around caen and nearly 300000 soldiers were killed 
caen 115 miles west of paris suffered 10000 civilian deaths 
caen mayor jeanmarie girault flew to london for the news 
conference at the imperial war museum 
he said france is spending nearly 21 million on the museum that 
will be opened on the june 6 anniversary 
the nations involved in the battle have been invited to send 
representatives for the opening the mayor said 
he said those countries were france east and west germany 
belgium britain canada czechoslovakia greece luxembourg the

accidents involving aeroflot flights killed 47 
people last year officials said friday 
they also said the soviet national airline made 33 billion and 
transported 119 million passengers in 1987 
aeroflot which claims to be the worlds largest airline is 
notorious for its flight delays and poor service officials from 
the ministry of civil aviation which operates the airline said a 
program was under way to improve aeroflots standards 
we people engaged in civil aviation are not satisfied with the 
safety and regularity of flights that now exist said boris e 
panyukov first deputy minister of civil aviation 
however airline officials said at a news conference that 
aeroflots safety record compares favorably with that of major 
western carriers 
last year 47 aeroflot passengers and crew members were killed 
in accidents said vladimir y potemkin deputy chief of flight 
services 
in the past soviet officials were reluctant to give details of 
aviation accidents and casualties but aeroflot has said that 
starting this year fatality figures would be made public a 
measure clearly linked to mikhail s gorbachevs drive for 
glasnost or greater openness on some issues 
on jan 18 an aeroflot jet missed the runway in the caspian 
port city of krasnovodsk flipped over and broke in two eleven 
people were killed and 12 others injured 
the official tass news agency and the government newspaper 
izvestia reported the crash the same day marking the first time a 
fatal soviet air accident was reported in the official media on the 
day it occurred 
officials told reporters that aeroflot plans to replace its 
planes with newer models 
panyukov said aeroflot will also lay off some of its 500000 
employees he did not say how many 
aeroflot responsible for all civil aviation in the soviet 
union has more than 15000 airplanes and helicopters he said 
aeroflot officials said the carrier made about 2 billion rubles 
last year the equivalent of about 33 billion

five rare old navigation charts on vellum the 
oldest dating from about 1460 will be sold in london in april 
auctioneers christies said the charts were found recently in 
europe after being hidden since the time of napoleons campaigns 
the sellers name was not disclosed 
two documents are by a wellknown family of chart makers the 
teixeiras of portugal and date from 1587 and 1620 
the oldest chart was made in genoa about 1460 and depicts the 
mediterranean and midatlantic 
another was by a dutchman and based on a portuguese model about 
1600 
the fifth is of the north sea and the baltic in 1588 by 
englishman thomas laton 
the finely inked and colored charts with flags coats of arms 
and even saints show ports in europe and africa and later in the 
americas they are expected to bring from 12000 to 87000 each 
at the april 13 sale 
for a long time before the french revolution the charts were 
owned by a flemish family the counts of maldeghem who were 
burgomasters of bruges now in belgium said sarah soames of 
christies books and manuscripts department 
she said laton worked in danzig now gdansk poland and was 
probably connected with the eastland co which traded english 
woolen cloth for polish grain 
independent art historian huon mallalieu said after examining 
the charts they are very rare things and would have been secret 
in their time because they were the valuable working tools of 
sailors they show the prevailing winds and routes around the 
world

the hamilton county grand jury indictment returned charges that 
harvey fatally poisoned two of the patients killed another by

leaders of the european economic 
community reached agreement early saturday on agricultural 
spending ending nearly a year of deadlock a spokesman for the 
executive commission said 
we have an agreement on a farm package we are having a good 
summit european commission spokesman nico wegter told reporters 
at the end of the twoday meeting 
the agreement came after significant concessions by prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain who had sought stringent 
budgetary controls to end soaring farm spending 
it has been a very tough european council mrs thatcher 
said early saturday but what is important is that for the first 
time we have effective and legally binding controls on 
expenditure 
the accord set production limits on the most expensive crops 
grains and oilseeds and proteins with penalty price cuts for 
surpluses 
it was the third summit attempt in eight months to solve the 
financial crisis the 12nation eec or european common market has 
operated without a budget since december 
proposals endorsed by west germany current president of the 
eec envisaged looser curbs on the communitys farm spending than 
britain initially was willing to tolerate 
the community agreement boosted by 80 percent over the next five 
years regional aid to the four poorest members spain portugal 
greece and ireland the increase will bring regional aid to 1625 
billion by 1992 compared with a 50 percent rise favored by the 
wealthier states inluding britain france and west germany 
west german spokesman friedhelm ost said his countrys 
chancellor helmut kohl did his best to change mrs thatchers 
mind in private talks friday evening 
the chancellor made it clear we now have arrived at the 
outer limits of what we can do ost told reporters 
on the key issue of overall limits on farm spending which 
consumes twothirds of the eecs annual budget the lastminute 
compromise document called for a 344 billion maximum this year 
slightly higher than in 1987 
that was consistent with british demands compared with a 369 
billion limit favored by west germany and france 
the compromise document also called for a 160million metric ton 
annual limit on cereal production the level wanted by west 
germany and france compared with 155 million tons sought by 
britain 
every ton above the 155 million costs the eec about 175 million 
annually in export subsidies 
as a sweetener to britain and the netherlands the proposals 
called for a 9 percent price cut spread over three years from 1989 
on the other most expensive crops oil seeds the final proposal 
called for price cuts and production quotas midway between british 
and other demands

eugene sawyer a 495 beef sandwich without charging him was fired 
friday for misappropriation of company funds 
police officers at the airport get free coffee sandwiches and 
doughnuts michael bueschel 23 said after getting his pink 
slip i figured if chicago police officers could get a free 
sandwich why couldnt the mayor 
bueschel said he was fired by management of midway airport 
restaurant inc when he reported to work friday afternoon 
he said the reason for his dismissal was listed as 
misappropriation of company funds 
sawyer upon hearing about bueschels firing was not pleased 
said the mayors press secretary monroe anderson 
he thought that they had carried policy to its extreme limit 
and that if the young man didnt find a job hed find him a job or 
give him a job himself because he didnt think the punishment fit 
the crime anderson said 
bueschel said restaurant managers guy accetura and michael 
oswald told him he was dismissed from the 5anhour job at the

said accetura wasnt at work late friday there was no home 
telephone listing for accetura in chicago directory assistance 
wlstv reported that restaurant managers thought they had to 
fire bueschel because other company employees had been dismissed 
for giving food away and they feared that making an exception would 
lead to a discrimination lawsuit 
its company policy not to give anything for free to friends 
and such but as far as the mayor is concerned i thought this was 
the way to take care of the guy bueschel said 
sawyer was at the airport on his way to a speaking engagement in 
alabama when he got his free meal from bueschel a sixmonth 
employee of the cafe 
a security officer for the mayor had ordered the sandwich which 
he then received with a note from bueschel on the takeout box 
mr mayor keep up the good work compliments of cafe volare 
bueschel said the mayor then returned the favor with a handshake 
and said thanks for the sandwich 
bueschel is a sophomore at richard j daley college a school

a team of doctors friday reattached a 
mans left hand to his arm 2 months after it was joined to blood 
vessels in his abdomen for temporary preservation following an 
accident 
twelve doctors and support staff spent 22 hours in surgery on 
mike thomas a 31yearold ironworker from cleveland ala he was 
listed in serious condition 
the accident in which thomas lost his hand was a pulling and 
tearing injury rather than a clean cut making it difficult for 
doctors to determine the extent of possible nerve damage they also 
were concerned about the potential for infection in the wound 
therefore they decided to attach the hand to his abdomen to 
preserve it for a future reattachment to his arm 
the blood flow has been reestablished but it might be weeks 
or months before we can determine how much function hell have 
said virginia perrin of university hospitals public relations 
office 
thomas might be able to leave the hospital within two weeks 
although further surgery might be needed she said 
so far so good seems to be the attitude right now mrs 
perrin said 
thomas lost the hand wrist and a small part of his forearm when 
he grabbed a cable to break a 70foot fall from a girder while he 
was working at a church nov 24 
the cable wrapped around his forearm and pulled his hand off 
about six inches above his wrist 
the day after thomas fell plastic and reconstructive surgeons 
attached the arteries veins and skin of the hand to those of his 
abdomen 
such a temporary attachment has been used twice once 
successfully in yugoslavia 
to our knowledge this is the first time a severed limb as 
been kept this way in the united states said hank black 
spokesman for the hospital 
the surgeons goal was to give thomas a hand with enough 
sensation to protect it from injury and to allow him the use of it 
as a helping hand one that is better in appearance than a false 
one black said

democratic presidential hopeful richard 
gephardt said friday that rival paul simon should withdraw negative 
advertisements from television and radio or take off the bow tie 
because hes just another politician as long as theyre on 
simon battling with gephardt for second place in new 
hampshires leadoff primary tuesday on thursday began airing ads 
that highlight what he called inconsistencies in gephardts 
record as a congressman from missouri 
after alluding to their intensifying dispute during a state 
democratic party dinner at which both spoke gephardt said at an 
impromptu news conference enough is enough on these negative 
ads 
gephardt said the spot impugns my character and my integrity 
by saying can you trust this man 
ive never impugned paul simons character ive disagreed 
with a lot of his crazy ideas but i have never once questioned 
paul simons motives or his integrity or whether he could be 
trusted gephardt said 
i asked sen simon to take those ads off television and if he 
doesnt he ought to take off the bow tie because hes just another 
politician as long as theyre on 
at an earlier appearance simon said he would be running 
different ads starting this weekend but not because gephardt asked 
him to 
after the democrats dinner simon said he did not believe the 
dispute with gephardt was harmful 
as long as it doesnt get too acrimonious i think a healthy 
comparison is good simon said 
from washington gephardts campaign counsel said telegrams had 
been sent to television stations in boston manchester and 
portsmouth me asking them to sell gephardt time for response ads 
to simon 
bob bauer said the stations have generally agreed to sell 
gephardt such time for the ad which will begin running saturday 
bauer said he had not seen the ad 
simons campaign has described the ads not as negative but as 
simply comparing the candidates records but gephardt said the 
spots question his motives by suggesting his record shows hes not 
trustworthy and he added 
i dont agree with ronald reagans balanced budget amendment 
that simon is for i dont agree with ronald reagans lineitem 
veto that hes for i dont agree with ronald reagans subminimum 
wage which hes for i dont agree with the senate version of the 
grammrudman bill which paul simon voted for and supported which 
would have been the fulfillment of reaganomics 
i dont agree with his changing his position on an oil import 
fee changing his position on whether we should talk to the 
palestine liberation organization changing his position on the 
balanced budget amendment 
gephardt added ive never questioned his motives i think 
hes trying to do what he thinks is right thats what i try to 
do 
so if were going to get into this business of going back 
through 8000 9000 votes its fine we can go through them all 
ill stand with every vote i made 
simon said he would not withdraw the ads aimed at gephardt we 
may be changing ads but were not going to do it in response to 
his request 
he said he had never claimed that there is complete 
consistency in my record or anyones record but there is a 
difference between absolute consistency which no one has and a 
pattern of inconsistency the positions that dick gephardt is 
taking today in the campaign are appreciably inconsistent with his 
positions in the past 
simon sed he did vote against one balanced budget proposal 
because it had unsound limitations he said he voted against an 
oilimport fee that lacked rebates for poor people and he flatly 
denied that he changed his position on the plo 
as he did in his initial response thursday to simons ads 
gephardt acknowledged that he has changed some of his positions 
over the years 
nobodys perfect things change you make a vote it didnt 
turn out the way you thought he said but to say someone is 
not to be trusted or someones motives are bad because you voted a 
certain way on the b1 bomber is just ridiculous 
gephardt and simon have acknowledged they essentially are 
fighting to place second in new hampshire at least for simon a 
thirdplace finish could pose severe trouble for his campaign 
gephardt came to concord after watching a sleddog race in 
laconia in the middle of a fierce storm that dumped more than a 
foot of snow on new hampshire on friday he had to change into dry 
clothes before the lawschool speech and he appeared before the 
standingroomonly crowd in blue jeans and a plaid shirt 
and before his speech gephardt said i dont take this 
election for granted you know when youre no 2 and youre trying 
to be no 1 its like avis youve got to try harder so im 
trying harder 
gephardt reiterated familiar themes in his speech stressing the 
need for an economic overhaul and painting himself as 
antiestablishment while calling his opponents apostles of the 
status quo

the army withdrew a fullpage advertisement from 
the february edition of student lawyer magazine because the issue 
featured an article on homosexual law students the magazines 
editor said friday 
the decision to pull the ad came shortly before a federal 
appeals court on wednesday overturned as unconstitutional the 
armys ban on homosexuals editor sarah hoban said 
it is very ironic the timing couldnt be better she said 
the cover article in februarys edition of the magazine a 
publication of the american bar association is titled the legal 
closet the piece by chicago freelance writer lynn miller is an 
examination of gay law students and contends that antigay fears 
and prejudices are common in law schools and within many law 
practices

many people who were afraid to discuss homosexuality in the note 
she said an advertisement had been withdrawn from the issue but 
did not identify the advertiser as being the army 
ms hoban told the chicago tribune on friday that the advertiser 
was the army and the ad had been withdrawn by the armys new 
yorkbased advertising firm young amp rubicam 
ms hoban said she suspected that the army might be bothered by 
the article so she had her advertising director contact young amp 
rubicam and tell the firm that the article would appear in the 
february issue 
young amp rubicam then withdrew the ad 
they didnt threaten us she said they just said they 
wanted to pull it its their right though im sorry they did it 
just a week before we went into production for this issue 
young amp rubicam could not be reached for comment by telephone 
late friday calls after business hours to the agencys chicago and 
new york offices went unanswered 
lt col john cullen chief of public affairs for the army 
recruiting command at fort sheridan ill said young amp rubicam 
consulted the army before deciding to pull the ad 
its not their money after all said cullen who said the 
agency had been told by student lawyer that the article contained 
material uncomplimentary toward the military 
the magazine initiated it and we took the option cullen 
said of the decision to pull the ad 
cullen said the army intended to continue advertising in future 
issues of student lawyer

highly efficient and obedient robots have 
replaced workers who used to shout strike slogans and have helped 
fiat vault from financial gloom in the 1970s to a leadership role 
in the worlds auto industry 
the task of turning a deficitburdened company faced with high 
absenteeism and low productivity into a vanguard highly 
profitable enterprise took nearly 10 years and required massive 
annual investments of about 830 million 
at one point the italian automaker turned to col moammar 
gadhafis libya for money but in a sign of financial health it 
bought back libyas minority share a decade later and avoided a 
threat to defense contracts from the united states 
the era of robotics took a heavy toll on the work force 
employment at fiat auto was cut by nearly half to 72000 workers 
by the end of 1987 from 138000 nine years earlier according to 
figures given by italian trade unions to the associated press 
by increasing automation fiat improved productivity and reduced 
costs ushering in a period of high profit that allowed the agnelli 
family which controls the company to expand its financial empire 
into telecommunications insurance banking and retailing 
vittorio ghidella who became the managing director of fiats 
auto division in 1978 and cesare romiti who took over as managing 
director of the fiat group a year later are unanimously considered 
the architects of the groups impressive recovery 
given a free hand by chairman giovanni agnelli whose family has 
been the controlling fiat shareholder since his grandfather founded 
the turinbased company in 1899 ghidella and romiti set fiats 
course through the end of this century after subduing the tough 
opposition of the metalworkers union 
through temporary layoffs of 24000 workers and the dismissal of 
61 involved in acts of violence and sabotage inside the factories 
during disruptive walkouts in 197980 fiat regained control of 
the plants and on production carlo besuzzo head of fiats work 
planning said in an interview with the associated press 
a march by 40000 foremen and white collar workers supporting 
fiats policy helped end 35 days of strikes in 1980 and foiled a 
possible occupation of the plants threatened by the most radical 
groups of strikers who were openly supported by the communist 
party 
during the most difficult years of labor tensions worsened by a 
drop in demand in the wake of the world oil crisis fiat was 
burdened with unsold stocks of about 500000 cars while absenteeism 
ranged from 15 percent to 20 percent 
ironically it was in large part the mounting opposition of 
trade unions to the traditional and stressful assembly line work 
that drove fiat toward heavy investments in computers and robots 
it was a dramatic but unavoidable choice said besuzzo 
fiat was the first european auto company to brave the risks of 
heavy investment in automation the result was a less expensive and 
better product and after some years an impressive economic 
improvement 
at present the fiat group relies on 1550 auto robots or about 
half the total robots in use in italy and besuzzo says there is 
more room for even more advanced automation in the fiat plants 
for sure we have a technological leadership over japanese and 
us makers in flexible robotized lines which can assemble parts 
of different models robots in the spray painting division could 
soon cover 60 percent of the production up from 40 percent while 
the percentage of robotized work in assembling parts would rise to 
25 from 3 percent he said 
many of the robotic systems have been supplied by fiats factory 
automation unit comau which has also sold systems to major 
european and american auto makers including ford and general 
motors 
the tipo the latest midsized model which is expected to boost 
fiats ambitions of becoming europes no1 automaker at the expense 
of west germanys volkswagen is being assembled in the factory at 
cassino which is europes most automated 
the model unveiled jan 26 has a competitive price in 
comparision with european models of the same class it required the 
most expensive investment for a fiat model nearly 16 billion 
however investment in automation has produced highly successful 
returns so far 
since the beginning of the decade the fiat group has nearly 
doubled net income from one year to the next

the auto division achieved a turnaround in 1983 after more than 
10 years in the red it had piled up estimated debts and losses of 
about 416 million by 1979 the auto sector accounts for 50 percent 
of fiats revenue now industrial vehicles tractors and 
earthmoving machines bring the total to about 72 percent 
the group boosted its net earnings to 522 million in 1984 to 
11 billion in 1985 and 18 billion in 1986 
fiat which last year took over statecontrolled alfa romeo to 
increase its dominance in the italian market has a 61 percent 
share of the domestic market of automobiles a higher percentage 
than any other major european car manufacturer and a 143 percent 
share in europe 
it holds a minor share of the us market as the bulk of its 
production is made up of smallsized cars however it has high 
hopes for the alfa romeo models the luxury 164 alfa italys most 
expensive massproduced sedan will be marketed aggressively in the 
united states while another fiat subsidiary the prestigious 
ferrari has a healthy market for its sports cars overseas 
in the face of growing automation and a modest increase of auto 
demand in europe besuzzo said fiats auto employment is not 
expected to rise or decline through the 90s 
franco lotito secretary of the metalworkers division unione 
italiana lavoratori uil one of the largest italian trade unions 
agreed with besuzzos predictions 
lotito emphasized that the sharp cut in employment resulting 
from robots at fiat did not cause a dramatic social impact thanks 
to layoffs subsidized by a state fund early retirements and 
reemployment of some workers in state jobs 
at the beginning we had nourished the illusion that automation 
could coexist with a high rate of employment he added in an 
interview that proved wrong yet we did not oppose technology in 
the factories because we were aware it was the only possibility to 
keep the auto industry competitive unions which opposed 
automation like in britain only caused the collapse of the 
companies and massive dismissals 
the growing health of the group and of the agnelli dynasty has 
recently been worrying some italian politicians 
the socialist party whose relations with fiat became tense 
following a bitter controversy over the candidate to head telit a 
joint telecommunications venture between fiat and the state holding 
copmpany iri accused the turin group and the agnellis of 
dominating italian industry 
some politicians called for an antitrust law on grounds that 
industrial and financing holdings directly or indirectly controlled 
by the agnelli family have a market capitalization equal to 228 
percent of the entire italian stock market 
fiats influence on the italian news media also came under 
questioning fiat owns the turin daily newspaper la stampa has 
effective control of the rizzoli publishing house and milans 
influential corriere della sera newspaper and has expressed some 
interest of moving into commercial television 
giovanni agnelli recently cooled down the controversy noting 
that fiat revenue accounts for less than 4 percent of the gross 
domestic product 
the three major statecontrolled holding companies together 
account for 10 percent and this is not causing any worry agnelli 
said 
agnelli is such a wellknown public figure that he is often 
referred to merely as lavvocato the title for a laywer in 
italy he holds a law degree he is always widely quoted whether 
it be on business or politics or italys most successful soccer 
team juventus which he owns

getting food to hungry people caught in 
mozambiques guerrilla war has become more and more risky and 
expensive for international relief agencies 
antigovernment guerrillas who have sabotaged rail lines and 
roads now have threatened to shoot down relief planes 
the international red cross stopped flying to areas outside 
provincial capitals last christmas after receiving a threat from 
the guerrillas 
care international which runs a famine relief food transport 
program in cooperation with mozambiques government is now 
operating airlifts to remote areas the red cross once served 
but we dont know how long we can keep it up said david 
neff an american who is cares director in mozambique 
he said it costs eight times more to move food by air than by 
truck but 16 districts in four provinces can be supplied only by 
plane six towns cannot be reached at all he added because of 
sabotage to the rail and road routes or the heavy concentration of 
the mozambique national resistance guerrillas fighting the 
marxistled government 
on a recent care flight that carried reporters to sena the main 
highway could be seen below pitted with trenches and blocked by 
tree branches tracks on the railroad line were torn up 
the guerrillas have rocketpropelled grenade launchers many of 
captured from the army but they can bring down a plane with a 
pistol if they hit you right said mike mispelaar cares 
international operations manager 
the guerrillas have blown up the longest railroad bridge in 
africa near sena they often carry away railroad tracks set 
explosives on the lines and have made road travel so dangerous that 
85 percent of western food aid doesnt move unless it can join an 
army convoy 
we cant count the cost of vehicles sitting idle waiting for 
convoys said neff 
most of the difficulty in getting grain from a seaport to a 
hungry refugee in the droughtstricken bush is due to guerrilla 
attacks on the transportation system 
until last year the guerrillas kept one of the nations primary 
rail road and oil pipeline routes the beira corridor inoperable 
most of the time 
but in 1987 mozambique arranged for troops from neighboring 
zimbabwe to guard the corridor between harare and beira and help 
defend the indian ocean port the corridor is zimbabwes cheapest 
route to the sea 
other neighbors also help soldiers from malawi are stationed 
along the nampulanacala route in the northern part of mozambique 
where sabotage still occurs regularly troops from tanzania have 
been assigned to guard recaptured towns freeing mozambican troops 
to retake other vital targets 
if you protect 10 percent of mozambique you protect 90 percent 
of the economy of the country said trade minister manuel jorge 
arandasilva in an interview you need only have the transport 
system linked with that 10 percent this is survival it is not 
growth 
most of the beira railroad track has been relaid with concrete 
ties instead of timber ones canadian rails and heavier ballast 
it is much harder to sabotage and an explosion is less likely to 
derail a train 
the nampulanacala line most useful for malawian exports in the 
north still needs to be relaid as does a line from zimbabwe down 
the limpopo river to maputo it goes through arid regions where 
security is difficult and where the track is so flimsy a saboteur 
can simply walk away with the rails 
moving donated food from overseas to nearly half of the 
mozambican population under such conditions requires constantly 
shifting strategies explained mispelaar who is from india 
immediately after you hear about a local highway blocking you 
move spare food up on available charters get everything off the 
roads in that area move other shipments up by sea reschedule 
certain donations so they go to a different port he said 
when the bandits rebels came to know about a shipment and 
attacked 60 kilometers 37 miles north of chokwe we couldnt move 
the other trucks we had kept back on standby bags start piling up 
looting starts you can tip the balance with the smallest mistake 
care nevertheless distributes more than 300 tons of food a day 
to market places and refugee centers throughout the country 
planes unload bags of corn and rice on air strips women wearing 
only wrapped skirts in the blazing sun trudge in single file for 
hours carrying the bags on their heads they often are guarded by 
soldiers 
some food is loaded onto tractors and taken over roads where 
land mines are hidden other bags are carried by canoes to isolated 
farming settlements 
food is a priority so there are shortages of clothes tools and 
seeds 
there are more people coming out of the bush to the 
resettlement camps said mispelaar they come with nothing but 
if you can give them a few seeds basic tools some bamboo poles 
and a little food they start building they start planting they 
are not totally dependent on handouts

past glories and future dreams of this 
economically depressed mining town two miles up in the rocky 
mountains are pinned to a bill now inching its way through congress 
the measure aims to bless the national mining hall of fame and 
museum now housed in the old lake county junior high school here 
in leadville with a federal charter 
such a charter brings no bucks but would qualify the museum for 
inclusion on lists of national historical sites and maps and other 
official documents and museum boosters believe that will lure 
thousands of mining buffs 
tourist dollars are badly needed in lake county where 
unemployment stands at 22 percent the highest in colorado the 
states average unemployment rate was 64 percent in october the 
last month tallied 
leadville is the highest town in north america and an historic 
mother lode of legends and lore from the bygone silver and gold 
rush days 
we think having the hall of fame and mining museum will 
provide a cornerstone for revitalizing leadville said state rep 
ken chlouber we may be one of the richest six cubic miles on 
earth because of our minerals but we have to diversify 
fiftyfour mining museums are scattered around the country 
according to the industry they range from oneroom displays to the 
new 11 million new mexico museum of mining at grants which 
spotlights uranium the world museum of mining in butte mont 
which showcases copper the american mining hall of fame in tucson 
ariz and an exhibition coal mine at beckley wva 
but none claims a national designation say backers who want the 
national mining hall of fame and museum to become an educational 
center for the entire industry 
the museum set up as a nonprofit corporation was chartered by 
colorado in 1977 and has members in 31 states industry giants such 
as amax phelps dodge corp and asarco support the idea and many 
mining executives serve on the board of trustees 
bills designating the leadville site as the nations official 
mining museum were introduced in congress a year ago 
on feb 4 the senate judiciary committee unanimously approved 
one version and sent it to the full senate with 40 cosponsors 
an identical resolution is stalled in the house with only half 
the 218 cosponsors required to move it through the legislative 
process 
museum advocates are chomping at the bit counting on the 
federal charter to help them raise 15 million to construct 
initial exhibits 
for more than a century leadville has been synonymous with 
mining in the 1800s thousands of adventurers dug gold and silver 
found in the towns namesake veins of lead from surrounding 
mountains 
legendary characters such as gambler and gunfighter doc 
holliday suffragette susan b anthony the unsinkable molly 
brown and english writer oscar wilde were attracted to the boom 
town 100 miles west of denver then a nondescript little frontier 
settlement 
in this century leadvilles soughtafter metal was molybdenum 
used to strengthen steel amaxs climax mine north of town which 
provided steady paychecks through two world wars and the great 
depression employed 3200 people in 1981 
but leadvilles mining collapsed in 1982 because of declining 
steelmaking and a world molybdenum glut climax now keeps just 48 
men on a skeleton maintenance force 
town leaders accustomed to leadvilles boombust history at 
first didnt believe largescale commercial mining was finished 
but as lake countys unemployment soared and for sale signs 
sprouted like weeds committees were formed to plot economic 
strategy 
leadville is 60 miles east of aspen 40 miles south of vail and 
surrounded by some of the nations most spectacular scenery 
including two of colorados highest peaks mount elbert and mount 
massive 
one campaign that fizzled over time was operation bootstrap 
aimed at coaxing more tourists to the town of 3300 people half 
the countys population 
the national mining hall of fame and museum was nothing but an 
idea looking for a home when a search committee received 
leadvilles application in 1986 
we heard there was a national competition for the mining 
museum and this community went after it said chlouber that 
effort marked the first time everybody in this town really came 
together and forgot about their little turf battles 
being out of work will do that to you said chlouber a 
former shift boss at the climax mine but now unemployed except for 
his legislative job which pays just 11500 a year when were 
all unemployed we support each other 
to lure the museum the school board offered the old junior high 
and its 71000 square feet of space for 50 cents rent a year the 
county donated parking and free utilities for two years the town 
offered office space snow removal and improved traffic routing 
colorado mountain college volunteered to make promotional films 
supply audiovisual help for exhibits and lend its local campus for 
mining seminars 
we need this museum said carol luoma who owns the golden 
burro restaurant with her husband jack both lost their jobs when 
the climax mine closed they gambled their life savings to buy the 
cafe on leadvilles main street 
weve got to all pull together to bring new businesses and 
attractions here this is a great place to live full of wonderful 
people and i hate to see many of them leaving because there arent 
any jobs said mrs luoma the museum can be our showpiece and 
help make leadville famous again 
robert reeder the museums executive director said the 
victorianstyle junior high building would eventually be converted 
to house a library geology hall lecture auditorium and rooms 
detailing the history of american mining the hall of fame plans to 
periodically pick a person whos made a major contribution to 
mining 
we want to show visitors theres virtually nothing you can 
look at that mining doesnt have some impact on said reeder 
did you know 17 minerals go into making newsprint that 14 
minerals are needed to manufacture basic cosmetics 
college enrollment in mining engineering is down in this 
country from 4000 students in 1977 to 616 this academic year 
said reeder we want this museum and hall of fame to stimulate 
peoples awareness of how important this industry is both its 
past its present and its future

kevin bacon and elizabeth mcgovern didnt mind 
playing two squares in the comedy hymn to marital fidelity shes 
having a baby in fact they liked the movies emphasis on 
oldstyle morals 
oldfashioned is newfashioned lets face it bacon said 
directorwriter john hughes is basically an oldvalues type of 
guy in all his movies mcgovern said and his story of a young 
couple jake and kristy briggs is a tribute to suburbia and to 
the virtue of commitment 
though the actors are young bacon is 29 mcgovern is 26 both 
are examples of another oldfashioned virtue hard work they 
recently talked about just how hard it was to bring out baby 
one scene the briggs wedding was shot over 26 consecutive 
hours it was filmed in the winnetka congregational church in 
illinois which was available for only a limited time 
two versions of the scene were filmed a straightforward 
account of the wedding and jakes hallucination about what his 
wedding vows really mean 
wilt thou listen to endless conversations about childrens 
clothes and decorator checkbooks the minister asks in the 
fantasy version 
the marathon session demanded a lot of bacon i actually fell 
asleep on my feet he said 
bacon who previously appeared in diner and footloose 
is on the screen in almost every frame of the film in one scene 
jake sits outside the church with his best man who tries to tempt 
him not to get married 
the struggle bacon says was to win the audiences sympathy 
despite the fact that his character is on the brink of jilting the 
beautiful kristy 
i really wanted him to seem like a little boy in a monkey 
suit and that was difficult bacon said 
mcgoverns travails were more subtle her character kristy 
appears bland but shes not said the actress 
kristy is very strong although she doesnt necessarily appear 
on the surface to be strong said mcgovern who first drew 
attention in the industry with her portrayal of timothy huttons 
girlfriend in 1980 in the academy awardwinning ordinary 
people the next year she had a supporting actress oscar 
nomination for her role in ragtime 
shes a person you wouldnt ever think twice about mcgovern 
said but before the end of the movie the door opens on her soul 
and you see how much there is she has to offer 
both actors lauded hughes direction as strong and 
independent as i come off on the set i need a director who will 
say ok thats good you got it bacon said hughes did that 
for him 
mcgovern agreed i always felt supported and i always knew 
that he would guide me 
by the end of the filming hughes trusted bacon to improvise 
one touching and funny result has jake trying natural childbirth 
methods massaging his abdomen and panting while kristy gives 
birth in another room 
by that point id been playing this character so many times 
and in so many different situations that i really felt that i knew 
him and john knew him and he just kind of said well turn 
the camera on and you just hang out in the room and do what you 
would do 
the tension bacon has felt in front of the camera in other 
movies didnt apply in this one he said john sort of blows all 
that tension right out of the water by letting the camera roll 
during retakes instead of shouting action or cut a lot 
the atmosphere during filming was relaxed enough for bacon to 
bring along his dog jane whom he calls a labrador deceiver 
a mutt thats part lab 
bacon and mcgovern are both accomplished on the new york stage 
and are used to feeding on the energy of an audience but in a way 
mcgovern said the director filled that function 
when he was looking at me he would see kristy he wouldnt see 
elizabeth she said

the normally staid community of french philosophers 
is in an uproar over the nazi past of martin heidegger the late 
west german whose philosophy had a wide following in france 
specialists have long known that heidegger whose classic 
being and time in 1927 influenced a whole generation of 
existentialist philosophers was once a member of the nazi party 
it has not been clear just how deep his fascist sympathies ran 
or how his disciples contributed knowingly or unknowingly to 
protecting his reputation 
heidegger one of the ranking philosophers of the 20th century 
has been a particularly dominant figure in france where his 
writings helped shape the thought of jeanpaul sartre and other 
thinkers 
twelve years after his death his standing is now threatened by 
the mushrooming controversy which focuses on the question were 
heideggers nazi ties a matter of opportunism selfpreservation 
and a weak character or a poisonous reflection of his lifelong 
belief in the superiority of the german people language and 
culture 
the book heidegger and nazism by victor farias a chilean 
philosopher and former student of heidegger at the university of 
freiburg in germany goes far beyond anything previously published 
about the german thinker 
farias found documents indicating that heidegger was a 
cardcarrying duespaying member of the nazi party until 1945 the 
year world war ii ended he argues that heidegger acted not out of 
circumstance or opportunism but out of a commitment to the 
principles of national socialism elitism discrimination and 
antisemitism 
he further maintains that heidegger resigned as rector of the 
university of freiburg in 1934 not because official university 
policy was pronazi but because it was too moderate farias says 
others later became the official party ideologues at the university 
only because heidegger was considered too radical 
while reaction to farias book has been loud and varied french 
philosophers are perhaps most troubled by the idea that heideggers 
nazi beliefs are the underpinnings of his thought 
francois fedier a devoted heideggerian called ferias book a 
shameless falsification and accused the author of tampering 
with documents 
heidegger was not a hero but neither was he the partisan 
activist and antisemitic denouncer of jews who emerges from the 
imaginary portrait painted by victor farias fedier wrote in the 
latest issue of debat a philosophy journal 
fedier did not deny heideggers attraction to nazism but called 
it merely a serious error in judgment heidegger did not see how 
dangerous hitler was he let himself be fooled 
in two recently published books the french deconstructionist 
jacques derrida traced the links between heideggerian thought and 
nazism critics praised the strength of derridas analysis but 
said he did not go far enough 
one would have liked to see derrida express his own moral 
indignation wrote robert maggiori in the newspaper liberation 
why be so polite why does heideggers work like a sword 
command its victims respect 
farias is less polite he devotes a chapter to heideggers first 
essay written in 1910 which extols the virtues of abraham a 
sancta clara a 17th century viennese monk known for his virulent 
antisemitism and xenophobia 
important people like abraham a sancta clara should remain 
alive in our hearts working silently in the soul of the people 
heidegger wrote then heidegger discussed sancta clara again in 
1964 and was no less laudatory 
heideggers later work denounced dehumanization in modern 
society yet as farias and others including maurice blanchot and 
philippe lacouelabarthe point out he never denounced the 
holocaust or uttered a single word of sorrow or regret over the 
death of millions of jews 
heideggers irreparable mistake was his silence on the 
extermination blanchot wrote in a letter published in le nouvel 
observateur a french weekly 
the controversy has also spread to germany where farias is a 
professor at the free university of berlin his book appeared first 
in paris only after being rejected twice by west german publishers 
the liberal weekly die zeit of hamburg in a recent article on 
the furor describes heidegger as a scared opportunist and 
not the hero type but says he was not an antisemite and 
questions whether he thought as a nazi acted as a nazi 
philosophically justified the nazi business 
the affair has had a much higher profile in paris perhaps 
because heidegger has not been as influential a figure in postwar 
german thought as he has been in france 
in 1934 heidegger was photographed wearing a nazi badge and was 
quoted as saying the fuehrer himself and alone is the present 
and future german reality 
for lacouelabarthe heideggers commitment to national 
socialism is absolutely coherent with his thinking 
in his recent book the fiction of politics lacouelabarthe 
quotes heidegger as comparing agriculture a motorized food 
industry to the fabrication of cadavers in the gas chambers 
and extermination camps the blockade of countries reduced to 
famine and the building of hydrogen bombs 
michel deguy a leftist philosopher also writing in debat 
argued that farias disclosures have been common knowledge for 
years he called the book weak conceptually and analytically 
and said it gained attention only through the mass media

in days of economic tension such as now bad 
news tends to land like a bomb while good news is seen as a mere 
respite not to be taken too seriously 
this explains to some degree why the recent good news hasnt 
caused any great commotion the dollar so unstable just weeks ago 
has settled down manufacturers are expanding exports are up the 
trade deficit has shrunk 
but will it continue thats the question 
today therefore was marked on calendars a long time ago as a 
day to watch it being the day on which the january us 
merchandise trade figures come out 
it could be the day on which good news makes as much noise as 
the bad another indication that americas trade deficit is 
improving could convince some cynics that the economy really has 
turned around 
suggestions of that turn have been dropped bit by bit over the 
past few weeks and months but they have been falling soft as 
snowflakes rather than hard as bombs 
us manufacturing for example is out of the doldrums in which 
it had been stranded for years production is rising output per 
manhour is up quality seems to have improved wage rates have been 
stable 
us exports have been improving the falling dollar was perhaps 
the one most important factor in the turnaround since it 
automatically made american goods less expensive abroad while 
putting pressure on imports 
but the story is more involved than that for several years 
american producers have been refining their production techniques 
refitting plants paring their payrolls and otherwise making 
themselves fit for competition 
in addition the attitude of confrontation between labor and 
management that for decades made battlegrounds of factories has to 
a very great degree evolved into one of cooperation in pursuit of 
shared goals 
in addition so gradually it has gone almost unnoticed there is 
also a greater awareness of exporting by even small companies that 
in the 1950s and 1960s were content to restrict sales to the us 
domestic market 
all this has been occurring without a great deal of bombast by 
anyone day by day the falling dollar got most of the attention 
but the falling dollar wouldnt have been of much help to exporters 
if they werent ready to export 
the dollar got much of the attention because it posed dangers as 
well as advantages but now the dollar has stabilized at a lower 
rate the dangers inherent in its fluctuations are greatly reduced 
but the advantage remains 
since the beginning of the year the exchange value of the 
dollar has gained 66 percent relative to the japanese yen 84 
percent against the west german mark and 69 percent against a 
basket of 10 major foreign currencies 
until the dollar stopped falling fears existed that foreigners 
would sour on us investments call their money home and undermine 
us stocks bonds and real estate that threat now has been 
greatly reduced 
if at the same time the united states can continue to raise 
exports and lower imports the good news probably will get the 
attention it merits while crisis headlines become the dust of 
history

happy noises hum down the halls of the 
progressive christian academy and filter into the paneled office 
principal betty tolbert stops her paperwork to listen attentively 
a substantial grayhaired woman she seems frozen in her swivel 
chair as she strains to catch the sounds coming from the 
classrooms a buzz of song recitation and prayer 
relaxing after a moment she nods approvingly a smile melts the 
concentration that had creased her forehead 
yes she says its a good sound the sound of children 
learning 
a bell rings and the halls are filled with children the girls 
are immaculately dressed in green plaid jumpers and white blouses 
the boys wear green pants white shirts and black ties 
the children have something in common besides the uniforms all 
482 have dark skins 
welcome to the progressive christian academy the only 
largescale allblack private christian school i know of said 
mrs tolbert the 53yearold founder and driving force behind the 
school our motto is all things are possible within the lord 
the nonprofit academy is housed in a onestory brick building 
atop a hill near downtown macon until 1983 the building was a 
public elementary school progressive christian is leasing it with 
an option to buy 
youre looking at a miracle here mrs tolbert said proudly 
as she walked down the hall past photographs of the rev martin 
luther king jr diana ross and bill cosby this place was a 
total wreck when we moved in 18 months ago now were a family 
were also a vital education center that is serving the needs of 
black children 
mrs tolbert said she came to perceive those needs in the 18 
years she was a public schoolteacher and principal 
it was clear to me that the public school system wasnt 
providing the moral guidance the loving discipline and the 
positive selfimage reinforcement that many children need in order 
to flourish she said 
in the summer of 1985 betty tolbert took the plunge with 
50000 in savings and loans she opened a trial summer school at 
the progressive baptist church where her husband is pastor 
we had 75 children and taught remedial reading and math with 
an emphasis on christian principles and the development of positive 
selfesteem she said it was incredible i began to see a 
change in those children on a daily basis and so did their parents 
they kept telling me their kids were so excited about the school 
that they didnt even have to get them up in the mornings 
that fall i quit my job as principal of an integrated public 
magnet school and opened this school which goes from k4 
prekindergarten through the eighth grade we started with 175 
students by the summer of 86 we had 400 students enrolled and 
had to move out of the church now with 482 students and 38 
employees weve got cramped quarters once again 
the progressive christian academy is one of four mostly black 
private schools including a tiny class run by seventhday 
adventists in bibb county some 5000 of the countys 30000 
schoolage children attend private schools most of them white 
most of our children came to us from the public schools where 
many were doing poorly she said they were developing poor 
selfimages and their parents were afraid their children were going 
to be lost 
kendall reid a sixthgrader feels he was one such student 
i was a little mouse i was so scared i just couldnt speak 
up he recalled of his three years in public school i had a 
white teacher in the first grade who told my parents i was 
retarded she and the kids used to make fun of me now im on the 
honor roll and i know im not retarded 
other students said they had to work harder at progressive 
christian and had fewer social and athletic activities yet still 
preferred their private school to public classrooms 
the kids here arent as mad as they were in public school 
said latonya raines an eighthgrader and the teachers really 
seem to care about you here 
bibb county commissioner william randall who worked to 
integrate the countys schools two decades ago said he found the 
present situation ironic 
ive got two grandchildren in mrs tolberts school including 
a grandson who wasnt doing well in public school randall said 
my grandson is doing much better now that hes in the private 
school 
mrs tolbert said her school in addition to providing a 
christian atmosphere gives the children positive role models 
they get to see black people in charge she said we also 
strive to instill in them the belief that everybody is somebody 
special we stress the worth of the individual 
she said her school also accommodates the students special 
needs and schedules 
for one thing she said were open from 6 am until 6 
pm which especially helps single parents we provide a warm 
loving atmosphere but we also stress academics and have volunteer 
tutors for highrisk failures then too we supervise the homework 
of those students who stay after school 
she said the parents pay 30 a week for one child and 50 for 
two or more they must provide books uniforms and lunches for 
their children 
several mothers interviewed as a group agreed they were 
thrilled with the school even though tuition money is hard to spare 
my little boy is happy now there hasnt been a day he hasnt 
gotten up and gotten himself ready for school morning can be an 
especially tense time for a single parent and i simply cant tell 
you how much this means to me said natalie coggins a social 
security claims examiner with two children at the school 
mrs tolbert said parents of eighthgraders want her to offer 
high school classes so children wont have to return to public 
school 
im also getting requests from parents outside the area to 
start a boarding school she added id like to do that but 
first we need to raise enough money to pay off our bills and 
complete our library which we need to do to be fully accredited 
the school now has provisional accreditation and plans a library 
fundraising drive 
i feel certain these things will all come in time meanwhile 
i must be doing something right its all i can do when i go out 
in the hall not to get knocked down by all the hugs i get

wary of the turbulent public school 
system and seeking the best possible academic environment for their 
5yearold son lawrence and kim dade enrolled the boy in private 
school 
the dades were one of many families who last year chose private 
schools over the little rock school district which was beginning a 
vast desegregation plan involving crosstown busing and the 
reassignment of students and teachers to achieve racial balance 
white flight has been a problem in the district for some time 
but the dades are black 
the dades son lawrence iii attends mcgraw learning institute 
the only black private school in little rock 
we wanted a positive strong school and basically a black 
school that was strong in academics dade said before we had 
taken our son to other schools and they didnt seem to have the 
care and really the motivation that it took because my son was 
brought up in a more mixed environment more whites than blacks we 
thought it was time to have the reverse as well as have a good 
academic background 
the mcgraw school has built a reputation for academic excellence 
since beginning as a preschool daycare facility in 1982 
patricia mcgraw founded the school in a converted grocery store 
near downtown soon after earning a doctorate in sociolinguistics 
at washington university in st louis 
i thought it was a necessity said ms mcgraw an english 
professor at the university of arkansas at little rock for about 
20 years ive taught on the college level and it has been my 
experience that many black students do not use the language well 
even after 12 years of schooling they do not feel good about 
themselves and generally most of them need something that has 
been lacking in the school systems 
in the beginning most of the pupils were the children of ms 
mcgraws students at college 
about 60 students mostly children of business and professional 
people now attend the institute more than half are preschoolers 
the rest in kindergarten through third grade 
the institute is certified by the state to teach through sixth 
grade and has a long waiting list 
students are taught basic reading writing mathematics 
geography science music and dance and learn french as well as 
english special emphasis also is placed on language development 
and computer training 
as important to most of the students parents ms mcgraw said 
are the lessons their children are taught in cultural awareness and 
social skills and the experience they get in being where blacks are 
the majority 
a very crucial and important part of our curricula is to be 
sure that these young people have good feelings about themselves 
and their people ms mcgraw said most often we are told very 
little about how we happened to be where we are at this school 
we teach young people parts of african and afroamerican history 
that can make them feel good about themselves that i know they 
dont get anywhere else 
these little folk come from a people that has been greatly 
neglected in this society so they need some special kind of 
emphasis to make them know that they are really something awfully 
great she said i think thats what we give them 
the school is not for everyone ms mcgraw conceded many 
families cannot afford the tuition and fees which total about 
2650 annually for the 12month program 
the school has several pupils of mixed race and one white child 
attends the afterschool program but its mostly black enrollment 
and its emphasis on black culture have discouraged some black 
parents ms mcgraw said 
many black parents have been conditioned to believe that 
things cannot be good if they their children are not mixed with 
white she said 
the small enrollment enables the schools five fulltime and two 
parttime teachers to give extra attention to individual students 
the one feature cited most by parents who enroll their children at 
mcgraw 
alma stewart described her 5yearold son curtis as a slower 
learner who has to be motivated 
he needs to be pushed some teachers classrooms at public 
schools are overcrowded and they dont take the time that they 
need to take to push our kids mrs stewart said thats my 
reason for sending him here 
shelly wilkinsrobinson said her daughter was further advanced 
academically than some other 4yearolds but was not getting the 
educational base she needed at another school 
at mcgraw shes already reading and knows phonetics numbers 
alphabets the way the teachers here have worked with her she 
knows now that she can read almost anything 
several students who got their early academic training at mcgraw 
have advanced rapidly in the public school system 
one 7yearold khiela holmes ranked in the top 1 percent in 
the nation in mathemathics on a national standardized test she took 
a year ago on average firstgraders in the little rock district 
ranked at the 57th percentile among firstgraders nationwide who 
took the metropolitan achievement test in the 198687 school year 
accordiing to sue tadlock a district evaluation and testing 
specialist 
khiela completed kindergarten at 5 had gone through the 
firstgrade math program within two months of her first year at 
public school and was doing thirdgrade math work by the time she 
reached second grade she also excelled in reading english and 
science 
khiela started at mcgraw at 2 and stayed there through 5 we 
feel that a lot of her ability now is attributable to what mcgraw 
did said her father tracy holmes all those years she had 
oneonone attention she excelled in all her studies and she 
enjoyed what she was doing 
thats the key he said they made her feel confident in 
what she was doing she felt good about herself 
a study by the urban league of arkansas concluded that black 
students in the state have not achieved in school at a competitive 
rate and it questioned whether they receive adequate early 
academic preparation in public schools 
without appropriate preparation during early school years the 
future academic achievement of black students is left to chance 
it said 
charles m hodge author of the study said the mcgraw school is 
a good alternative particularly for younger students to public 
schools which he said are largely insensitive to the needs of 
blacks 
that the school is predominantly black and emphasizes black 
culture is not inconsistent with desegregation efforts said hodge 
dean of the university of central arkansas college of education 
in fact theyre probably doing more in addressing the issues 
of a multiracial society he said

when former congressman jack tanner arrives at a 
scenic new hampshire farm for a photo opportunity the farmer 
chides him are you my 1030 youre late 
all along the crowded new hampshire campaign trail tanner 
played by michael murphy is constantly bumping into the other 
candidates pat robertson gary hart bob dole they play 
themselves 
all make cameo appearances in the premiere episode of hbos new 
series tanner 88 the dark horse making its debut tonight 
just in time for the new hampshire primary the next episode will 
be aired in march 
the limitedrun series is a collaboration between director 
robert altman and cartoonist garry trudeau they have created a 
fictional presidential candidate surrounded him with a loyal staff 
and will follow his progress through the 1988 presidential campaign 
at one point in the first episode set in new hampshire 
tanners campaign manager tj cavanaugh pamela reed complains 
to the artsy filmmaker who produced the candidates video 
biography deke if you use the term neorealism one more time 
 
neorealism is in fact the term that springs to mind when 
describing the series reminiscent of both medium cool haskell 
wexlers 1969 quasidocumentary on the 1968 democratic convention 
and the candidate michael ritchies 1972 film starring robert 
redford as a reluctant mr clean drafted to run for the us senate 
but tanner is mostly a reflection of altman himself an 
early innovator in neorealism his nashville and the 
wedding broke new ground in filmmaking with improvised dialogue 
and their unflinching examinations of american morality 
trudeau of course put politics on the funny pages with 
doonesbury and tanner gives him a vast new forum for 
political satire and commentary 
between the two of them altman and trudeau have created a 
searingly insightful dramatization that could shed more light on 
the 1988 election process than any number of network commentators 
and newspaper columnists 
in episode one tanner and his staff arrive in new hampshire to 
find a state full of jaded mediawise voters who cringe at the 
thought of another candidacy even though tanner is goodlooking 
likable competent and wellintentioned 
the premise of his candidacy is that since joe biden dropped out 
of the race tanner has stepped in as the generational 
candidate the only one among the lot he says who can say without 
thinking which beatle was his favorite 
tanner gave up his michigan congressional seat in the 1970s 
because his daughter had cancer hes now divorced his daughter 
alex played by cynthia nixon has long since recovered and is 
helping with the campaign 
tanner did poorly in iowa and arrived in new hampshire with 
barely enough momentum to rent a seedy motel room and buy a few 
pizzas for volunteers the only news media interest in him consists 
of a lone boston reporter doing a series of psychological profiles 
of the candidates 
when tanners campaign film is shown to a test group of voters 
they hoot at its undraped sentimentality theres hope though 
they react favorably to the candidate himself its when the film 
seeks to manipulate them that they get turned off 
it could be the process itself says the media consultant 
its tedious its long what they may be resisting is another 
candidacy 
while the media consultant tries to figure out how to sell the 
candidate tj is contending with phone calls from joe kennedy who 
apparently is trying to get her to help his own campaign dont 
hang that on me she says at one point in the onesided 
conversation that was a victory party i was drunk and that was 
just a figure of speech 
after a depressing day of campaigning tanner returns exhausted 
to the motel where a mystery woman is waiting for him and stops 
by the campaign office 
there the campaign filmmaker surreptitiously captures in 
redhot cinema verite tanners unrehearsed but eloquent tirade on 
patriotism 
the campaigns new slogan tanner for real on to super 
tuesday

sportswriter dan jenkins popularized the 
phrase dead solid perfect to describe a wellstruck golf shot 
and he wanted just that quality in the movie of his novel about a 
cinderella barmaid named juanita 
i like this one jenkins says of baja oklahoma which 
home box office will premiere this saturday when jenkins pro 
football novel semitough was made into a burt reynolds movie 
in 1977 most of the book had disappeared 
the adaptation of baja oklahoma is 500 times more faithful 
than what happened to semitough it was great having a producer 
and director busting their chops to make it more faithful 
jenkins says 
baja oklahoma which is another way of saying texas tells 
how juanita hutchins who works in herbs bar amp grill finds true 
love with a guy named slick and happiness as a country singer her 
ticket to fame is her tune baja oklahoma goodbye pearl beer 
and chickenfried steaks hello nashville 
lesley ann warren stars as juanita peter coyote as slick 
swoosie kurtz as juanitas friend doris billy vera as 
singersongwriter lonnie and anthony zerbe as disc jockey ol jeemy 
williams bobby roth directed from a screenplay by roth and jenkins 
in addition willie nelson emmylou harris and bob wills appear 
as themselves alice krige plays patsy cline the movie was filmed 
mostly on location in texas with more than 2000 extras used in 
the scenes filmed at billy bobs texas a huge honky tonk in fort 
worth 
juanitas song of baja oklahoma was in the book as was her 
hero willie nelson 
willies an old friend said jenkins ive known him for 
20 years i called him up and asked him if hed write the music for 
it we went up to lake tahoe where he was working and he wrote 
the music for two verses in 10 minutes willie says it aint 
stardust but it aint bad 
jenkins has lived in new york city for more than 25 years but 
looks and sounds like he just came in from his hometown of fort 
worth texas he still has a texas drawl hes tall and still has 
most of his youthful slimness but his hair is white and thinning 
on top with his cigarette he could be a slightly overthehill 
marlboro man his wife june operates mexican restaurants in fort 
worth new york and florida named juanitas after the heroine of 
baja oklahoma 
jenkins spent 23 years as a senior writer at sports illustrated 
then left in 1984 to write a weekly syndicated column and columns 
for sports digest and playboy magazines hes also written four 
novels semitough dead solid perfect baja oklahoma 
life its ownself and limo coauthored with bud shrake a 
fifth tentatively titled dont write me nothing that rhymes a 
period comedy about the newspaper business is near completion 
i write comedy romances he said adding with a grin i 
write novels to support my journalism habit journalisms my first 
love it keeps you alert i love novels but writing news is my 
real love 
one of his three children sally jenkins is a sportswriter for 
the washington post 
baja oklahoma has been through several typewriters on its 
way to becoming a movie frank pierson wrote the first two 
screenplays joan tewkesbury wrote another version 
then i got a call from producer marykay powell asking me to 
write the screenplay jenkins said it was going to be a 
theatrical picture with george roy hill directing and shirley 
maclaine playing juanita it would have been a different movie 
more of a big comedy now its more of a love story but we keep 
some of the comedy 
given all the compromises you have to make adapting a novel to 
the screen it was a good experience it made me like hollywood 
again 
jenkins believes he can finish his latest book in about another 
month its set in the 1930s and 40s so ive had to do a lot of 
research he said i wanted everything to be accurate if 
somebodys talking about something in the news i want it to be 
right its got a lot of old radio stuff too and thats all 
accurate im a radio freak

a smallbusiness survey released today indicates 
inflation could become a worsening problem during 1988 
the national federation of independent business which studies 
responses from more than 2000 member firms each quarter said a 
trend toward more frequent and larger price increases has become 
quite evident 
while signs of economic deterioration werent sharply defined in 
the latest study the inflation component jumped sharply said 
professor william c dunkelberg who interprets the findings 
dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of business said 
27 percent of all companies in the survey said they plan to raise 
prices a 6 percentage point jump from the previous survey and the 
highest level in several years 
the sharp rise in price expectations among respondents is 
considered significant for the economy as a whole since the 
smallbusiness community produces about 50 percent of the nations 
gross private product 
in spite of the negative implications of the inflation component 
and despite expressions of doubt about the economys future the 
survey showed businesses plan to spend on equipment inventory and 
additional jobs 
such spending plans said dunkelberg appear inconsistent with a 
rise in negative opinions about future business conditions 
each year since 1985 he said the percentage of companies 
expecting a worsening of conditions rises while the number 
anticipating better markets shrinks simultaneously those 
declaring it to be a good time to expand fell to just 13 percent of 
all companies a fouryear january low 
apparently many believe the law of gravity applies to 
economic statistics as well as to apples he said explaining 
that the longer the recovery continues the greater is the 
percentage believing it will end 
negative and positive variations in the january report left the 
smallbusiness optimism index almost unchanged at 1018 seasonally 
adjusted compared with 1023 in the previous quarter 
the index which sets 1978 as its base is made up of responses 
to 10 questions including expected business conditions current 
job openings plans for capital outlays expected credit 
conditions and changes in net earnings 
the latest reading of the optimism index which was begun in 
late 1974 compares with an alltime high of 1087 in january 1984 
and an alltime low of 811 in the second quarter of 1980 except 
for brief dips in the final quarters of 1985 and 1986 the index 
has exceeded 100 in every survey since early 1983 
some highlights of the components include 
employment strongest hiring plans since 1978 nineteen 
percent of companies plan to increase employment in the next three 
months while 5 percent plan net reductions 
job openings reached a new high for the expansion with 23 
percent reporting unfilled positions in new england the 
percentage was 42 percent 
new hiring plans were strongest in manufacturing with 28 
percent planning increases and only 8 percent planning workforce 
reductions 
interest rates average interest rates paid by small companies 
held at 111 percent in the fourth quarter of the year fifty 
percent of all shortterm loans were tied to the prime rate 
prices there are indications dunkelberg said that inflation 
could be worse than generally anticipated based on plans to 
raise prices nonfood inflation should begin to pick up heading 
toward the 5 percent level 
commenting on the decline in business expectations dunkelberg 
said if this view produces a caution in spending on the part of 
more and more decisionmakers the economy cannot help but slip 
the big exception to this he added is if foreigners become 
exceptionally aggressive buyers of us goods

one evening last fall americas most 
distinguished living playwright stood on a bare stage at the los 
angeles theater center and read to an audience whose reverence 
overflowed in explosions of laughter sighs and standing ovations 
this soldout promotion for his autobiography timebends a 
life grove press 2495 demonstrated arthur millers enduring 
popularity with american theatergoers who remember death of a 
salesman and the crucible an audience he fears is becomming 
extinct 
maybe its a minority art at this point he says of his 
great love the theater that doesnt mean its less valuable 
the masses arent always right 
earlier in the day miller had reflected on the travails of the 
american theater and his own unhealed wounds from years of critical 
attack he voiced with some reticence his perception that the media 
collaborated in the destruction of his second wife marilyn monroe 
and although he is at work on another play he expressed 
hesitation at reentering the often brutal arena of the new york 
theater 
the prospect of battling the theater again is not something i 
look forward to he said 
when i began the theater was the most exciting of media it 
was full of adventure social protest and the new discoveries of 
theater teacher and director constantin stanislavsky some of the 
best actors were involved in theater rather than the movies 
what changed that he surmises was an escalating standard of 
living which pushed ticket prices out of the reach of the average 
person and a new breed of critics who didnt understand 
the crucible was shrugged off by reviewers when it opened 
in 1953 he said that makes me wonder what else is being 
shrugged off 
a sturdy energetic 72 miller has found a new fascination in 
book writing his next project may be a novel his 599page 
autobiography offers a rich pastiche of memories from his 
depression era childhood from his painful marriage to the most 
famous movie star in the world and his equally painful 
confrontation with the house unamerican activities committee 
some reviewers have questioned the rambling form of 
timebends which follows no particular chronological order but 
miller with characteristic confidence sees it as a breakthrough 
i believe the form of this book is new and it fascinates me 
the book is written the way we rememeber not the way movies 
used to show it by flipping calender pages backwards and not as a 
hurdler going over hurdles one after the other he says 
we remember in connected images the mind has no sense of time 
as far as the emotional life is concerned time is liquid in this 
book like a wave that rolls over on itself im bending time 
dredging up memories of his fouryear marriage to miss monroe 
appears to have been difficult 
any of the personal relationships are difficult and painful 
to write about he says but anything that doesnt make the 
author feel pain is probably not worth writing in the first place 
if youre revealing the world youre revealing yourself 
there is a revelation of a consuming love which drew him into 
the unseemly marriage to the actress 
she was a whirling light to me then he writes all 
paradox and enticing mystery street tough one moment then lifted 
by a lyrical and poetic sensitivity that few retain past early 
adolescence 
i was in a swift current there was no stopping or handhold 
she was finally all that was true 
there is some selfcriticism by miller for failing to save the 
actress from her own demons but more often he blames her demise 
on others the hollywood hierarchy of directors acting coaches and 
gossip columnists who fed the monroe myth but denigrated her 
efforts to become a serious actress 
his hardest jibes are at the press which dogged her during their 
marriage and in his opinion conspired to portray her in the most 
unflattering light possible 
i dont blame the press he says the press can 
collaborate in harming somebody but they dont do it 
singlehandedly she was frustrated by the press she wanted to be 
taken more seriously and every time she tried to pick herself up 
off the floor they would then kick her in the face an actor is at 
the mercy of the press 
he is asked whether miss monroe a sex symbol in a prefeminist 
era might have fared better today 
yes i think so he says she was a victim of the 
hypocrisy of the 50s it was hard not to be but the hypocrisy 
continues the tears keep being shed by people who did their best 
to destroy her 
of his own life so eloquently recounted in timebends 
miller says he has few regrets 
im very fatalistic about it its not that theres a mystical 
fate but ones character determines ones fate i simply created 
this life of mine the same as your handwriting is yours and cant 
be different we do make our lives and were free to choose in 
one way or another

this town of cobblestone streets and 
sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in india but 
millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their 
sins in its holy lake 
pushkar is a place revered by hindus and even by some foreigners 
who seek out its tranquility 
its beginnings lie with lord brahma the creator of the universe 
in hindu mythology hindu texts have it that when brahma was 
seeking a place for a holy ceremony he chose pushkar 
he dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the 
desert to form a lake according to the texts that date from the 
8th century bc 
in these modern times as the sun rises hindu pilgrims chant 
mantras and take a dip in pushkar lake believing all their sins 
will be washed away by the holy waters 
europeans and americans often are seen by the lake sharing the 
religious experience they feed grain to pigeons and sweets to 
longtailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the towns 
400 temples where ascetics hindu monks and other holy men gather 
pushkar a town of 9000 people is an oasis of tranquility far 
removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of bombay new 
delhi and calcutta 
the blazing sun soaks into everything 
it was the sacred month of kartik signifying the onset of 
winter when lord brahma is said to have dropped his lotus blossom 
brahma foremost in the hindu trinity of supreme gods had been 
looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony 
but his wife savitri could not attend the ritual angered she 
decreed that henceforth brahma would be worshiped at only one place 
pushkar became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of 
creation while millions of shrines were erected across india to 
lord shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like kali and 
durga who are often depicted as firespitting images carrying heads 
of evil men they had slain in battle 
but this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for 
the hindus almost equal in importance to benaras the eternal 
city hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in 
benaras 
pilgrims come by the thousands to pushkar 250 miles southwest 
of new delhi to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of 
brahmas majestic rite every year on kartik poornima the full moon 
night in the month of november 
shielded by nag pahar or serpent mountain pushkar has indias 
and perhaps the worlds only temple to brahma 
the town centers on the lake where there are several steps for 
bathing signs warn foreigners not to wear shorts and other 
revealing clothes not to smoke drink near the lake or take 
photographs not to kiss embrace or indulge in other irreverent 
acts 
the steps called ghats are controlled by vigilant and 
aggressive brahmin priests who preside over religious ceremonies 
armed with horoscopes they watch every pilgrim approaching the 
lake and pounce on potential clients 
each visit is recorded in their bulky clothcovered books a 
priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited 
pushkar by referring to the dogeared notebooks 
displeasing a priest can be unpleasant he will pronounce curses 
on ones entire family naming all the grandfather father and 
sons 
from the lake the steps lead up to the main street a favorite 
shopping center with the tourists the shops are stacked with 
exotic handicrafts peasant skirts and other clothes native to this 
part of india velvet shirts and pajamas musts for lowbudget 
travelers hang in vibrant displays

annie sims the preachers wife delivered the 
prophecy at a noon prayer meeting late in december 
the lord said he was going to send a tornado and many shall 
die she recalls saying god spoke through her during the prayer 
service he was going to send his fury and vengeance on the 
people 
so 17 faithful members of the repairer of the breach church of 
god in christ gathered at their small westside church a converted 
twostory frame house on jan 3 to await the wrath of god 
the congregation has been waiting faithfully peacefully ever 
since 
any day now any moment members believe god will send a 
tornado spinning down from the heavens to smite the wicked and 
spare the righteous and spare their church 
their number includes a school teacher a recent college 
graduate a college freshman and a restaurant worker with a 
management degree 
they have sacrificed jobs and education as well as the respect 
of family and friends who question their sanity 
the congregation has been challenged by the power of the state 
too 
five members have been removed under court order though two of 
them have returned since undergoing forced psychiatric 
examinations two children were taken from their mother and 
returned to school and a 51yearold man was ordered to undergo 
kidney dialysis treatment 
but unlike a mormon polygamist clan in utah whose recent 
resistance of police ended in a shootout that killed one officer 
these religious fundamentalists have quietly accepted the 
intrusions 
were not against the court says ml sims the church 
elder and preacher the husband of annie if god allows it to 
happen then thats it 
sims 36 says hes also lost the support of national church 
headquarters in memphis tenn which ordered him to take down a 
sign proclaiming affiliation until the lord says to move it 
its going to be up he says 
a woman who answered a call at the memphis headquarters said no 
one was available to discuss the matter 
despite the challenges from outsiders sims and the church 
members welcome visitors and talk freely all profess an 
unshakeable belief in the tornado none say they want to leave 
the 39yearold mrs sims first prophesied the tornado would 
strike jan 3 then jan 24 both dates passed uneventfully the 
simses now say god delayed the tornado to gain time to spread the 
warning no new date has been set 
itll be pretty soon says sims its nationally known 
now 
no ones faith is shaken by the delay or by meteorological 
precedent 
tornadoes can occur anytime but most of the tornadoes in this 
area occur from march through june and then again late in the 
fall said national weather service forecaster larry mowery who 
says he cant recall a midwinter tornado ever striking the area 
religion professor patrick olivelle chairman of the department 
at indiana university says apocalyptic visions are common 
religious themes 
of course there are always reasons why the end never comes 
he said i always tell my students that religion is not logic 
and you cannot put logical questions to that 
one of those waiting in the church david freeman a 24yearold 
graduate of grinnell college with a major in spanish said 
theres no doubt in my mind or in anyones mind that its going 
to come 
freeman stopped showing up for his bank tellers job after jan 
3 then called the bank to explain they didnt really understand 
it he said but after the tornado comes theyll understand 
and theyll congratulate us for standing up for the lord 
the family of ruschell harris a gary school teacher and her 
16yearold daughter jeanetta won the court order compelling the 
two to undergo psychiatric evaluation 
really at the time they felt i was so deeply under the 
influence of pastor that we couldnt do our own thinking she 
said if i believe something and its different from what you 
believe does that make me insane and you not 
mrs harris said she and her daughter returned voluntarily to 
the church after a psychiatrist found them competent 
im 47 years old ive been teaching for 20 years ive taken 
my daughter out of school said mrs harris indignantly do you 
think i would be here if i didnt believe it 
jeanetta says it doesnt matter shes missing out on school 
it doesnt bother me because after the tornado the school may 
not be there 
a court gave custody of patricia sanders two sons allen 
simmons 13 and charles russell 12 to a brother who will return 
them to school child welfare authorities took the children from 
the church 
i dont fight that theyre just doing their job says mrs 
sanders they dont understand because this is spiritual 
the days are occupied with informal services talking and just

the second wave of oscar hype and hoopla 
begins this week when nominations for the 60th academy awards are 
announced with as many publicists attending as press 
broadcast news the last emperor moonstruck and 
hope and glory seem certain to place high in the wednesday 
nominations judging from critics awards and hollywood consensus 
the earlymorning announcement will be held at the beverly hills 
headquarters of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences 
while reporters phone in stories to their news organizations 
publicists will telephone their clients and bosses with the good or 
bad news and return to their offices to plot the second phase of 
the oscar campaign 
campaigning is a dirty word in the industry but most people 
in the movie business do it 
we dont like it but we cant stop it sighs academy 
president robert wise 
the academy expressed its feelings in a message to members in 
the reminder list of eligible releases you will be importuned by 
advertisement promotional gifts and other lobbying tactics in an 
attempt to influence your vote each year these crude and excessive 
solicitations embarrass the academy embarrass you and demean the 
significance of the academy award 
yet this years campaign appears as intense as ever with 
estimates of the total cost run as high as 5 million 
i dont know how much attention is paid to the campaigns by 
the voters wise said not much i suspect i know they have no 
influence on my vote i rely solely on my own judgment 
i think the campaigns are justified only to call attention to 
a good film that has been released early in the year thats the 
only way im influenced i read about the tin men which was 
released earlier in l987 and i said to myself yeah that was a 
good picture 
you cant influence academy members said booker mcclay who 
has directed campaigns for universal pictures for the past dozen 
years these are professionals who have spent years in the 
business and seen thousands of films you cant hustle them 
the main goal is to get the voters to see your picture you do 
everything possible so they can see it at their convenience 
mcclays big push this year is for universals prestige film 
cry freedom which has performed disappointingly at the box 
office in its limited release since november the film has had 21 
special screenings at the studio theater including those for the 
actors writers and directors guilds academy members can also show 
membership cards for admission at theaters showing cry freedom 
tristar pictures took extreme measures to insure exposure for 
gaby a film about a handicapped woman it has been praised by 
the critics but has failed to attract an audience 
we really really love the film said peter silberman west 
coast publicity vice president for tristar we felt we needed to 
do something special to make it more available for academy members 
so we sent out 2500 cassettes of gaby this is believed to be 
a firsttime event for a film that is still in theatrical release 
the most visible form of campaigning is advertising in the 
hollywood reporter and daily variety every winter the trade papers 
bulge with ads proclaiming films and filmmakers for your 
consideration one publicist estimates the cost per page at 
5000 including creative color printing and space charges 
lets face it the trades are our bibles comments marketing 
consultant lloyd leipzig the question is how many ads to run 
if you run too few you dont get consideration too many and 
youre accused of overkill the voter says theyre trying to buy 
me 
mcclay said universal ran only 14 ads for out of africa 
prenominations and the film ended up with the best picture award 
of 1985 on the other hand orion pictures bought 65 ad pages for 
amadeus the best picture winner for 1984 
publicity plays in important role in academy campaigns cher 
for example has recently been on four magazine covers and has 
appeared on most of the important tv talks shows all of this 
brings attention to moonstruck for which she seems certain to 
be nominated as best actress 
cher has been very cooperative said john flinn a publicity 
veteran who is conducting the moonstruck campaign for mgm we 
also brought olympia dukakis to hollywood for a round of 
interviews director norman jewison has done good work for us 
even nicolas cage who usually doesnt do publicity has agreed to 
some college interviews 
but what does a publicist do when stars wont agree to 
interviews lloyd leipzig faces that problem in his campaign for 
ironweed meryl streep and jack nicholson would do no publicity 
its a tough harsh uncompromising relentless movie said 
leipzig of ironweed which concerns hobo life in 1930s buffalo 
not the kind of movie america is into this year 
its a movie that requires a lot of screenings and not only in 
los angeles and new york he said ive also arranged screenings 
for the 100odd academy members in london 20 in paris and 15 in 
rome 
studios also promote their films with expensive brochures which 
are mailed to academy voters members of the music branch are 
inundated with cassettes and albums of songs and scores 
after the nominations the campaign continues but usually with a 
more dignified tone 
youve made it this far you dont want to blow it with too 
much hype cautioned one publicist it never works

with drug abuse blamed for 20 percent of aids 
cases in western europe several countries are exploring ways to 
get clean needles to addicts to slow the spread of the disease 
the goal is to help addicts stop sharing needles and cut their 
risk of passing aids to each other and to the general population 
the world health organization is encouraging national campaigns to 
reduce needlesharing as part of its global strategy to combat aids 
the netherlands britain and switzerland have introduced 
extensive needle exchange programs 
elsewhere health authorities are using other approaches to make 
syringes and needles more widely available to keep addicts from 
sharing equipment 
in copenhagen denmark for example addicts or anyone else 
can now pick up free syringes and needles at drugstores after 
closing hours they can buy a syringe and two needles for the 
equivalent of 80 cents from sidewalk dispensing machines 
although male homosexuals have been most at risk from aids drug 
abusers now account for 20 percent of cases reported to the world 
health organization in geneva from western europe and 25 percent 
from the united states 
dr manuel carballo chief of social and behavioral research for 
the organizations global program on aids said in an interview 
that there is also evidence that drugtaking by injection is 
increasing 
if aids is introduced into the general population of western 
countries on a large scale carballo said it will probably be 
because of drug abuse through sexual contact with infected 
addicts including prostitutes and from pregnant women to their 
babies 
in january aids experts from 23 countries met at the world 
health organizations headquarters to review ways of dealing with 
the rise in aids among intravenous drug abusers 
among proposals they considered were giving addicts bleach to 
clean needles providing washing facilities in drug clinics 
information campaigns and needleexchange programs 
carballo said the main objection to exchange programs was that 
they could be seen to condone the use of drugs 
under such programs addicts receive free syringes and needles 
in exchange for their used ones at the same time health 
authorities offer advice on aids and drug treatment 
even though the world health organization has not publicly 
endorsed needle exchange carballo said he favors the idea when 
combined with efforts to reduce drugtaking 
if we accept that needlesharing is one of the primary routes 
of hiv infection then it stands to reason that the longterm 
effect of these programs may well be the cutting down the potential 
spread of hiv the health official said 
hiv stands for human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
intravenous drug users sometimes share needles not only because 
of short supplies but also as a social gesture in the way 
marijuana users pass joints 
carballo said evidence from the netherlands and britain 
indicates that exchange programs can reduce needlesharing 
although there is no evidence yet of a reduction in aids infection 
the dutch program began in 1984 and is by far the most extensive 
in the world it is centered in amsterdam the capital which is a 
haven for drug abusers with an estimated 7000 addicts 
municipal spokesman gijs van stijgeren said the city distributes 
600000 needles a year no questions are asked and no names taken 
the spokesman said a small proportion of the nations 400 aids 
patients are drug abusers adding that the amsterdam program 
doubtlessly has been of great influence in slowing the rate of 
infection another contributing factor however could be that many 
heroin addicts in the city prefer smoking the drug to injecting it 
the british program began last april as a oneyear experiment 
with the establishment of 15 needleexchange clinics in england and 
scotland results have been uneven 
the program has recruited about 2000 addicts nationwide and 
some larger clinics such as the three in london are seeing as 
many as 50 people a day officials say 
but a program set up in dundee scotland collapsed after six 
weeks in what was described as an atmosphere of acrimony between 
health workers and their clients one addict in a fit of anger 
reportedly sprayed blood from a syringe on a worker 
in glasgow scotland local residents picketed the clinic for 
six months maintaining that it would attract junkies and pushers 
into their neighborhood the protests have since died out and 
officials say the program is going smoothly 
much attention has been focused on edinburgh the scottish 
capital which has a notorious problem with hard drugs 
unlike england where drug abuse accounts for 1 percent of all 
reported aids cases 60 percent of aids carriers in scotland are 
intravenous drug users and the majority of them live in edinburgh 
carol tinto administrator of the lothian health boards aids 
prevention team which is in charge of edinburghs program said it 
has been a qualified success 
tinto said the clinic has had 115 clients including 50 or so 
regulars but it has not been able to recruit large numbers because 
it was set up to be open one afternoon a week and distribute only 
three needles at a time to each addict 
the monitoring research group at the university of londons 
goldsmiths college has produced a confidential report on the 
british program and the government will not disclose its findings 
until the report is studied 
dr gerry stimson a sociologist who led the research would not 
discuss the groups overall assessment but said some of the larger 
clinics have been very successful in attracting new clients 
major cities in switzerland launched anonymous needleexchange 
programs one year ago in zurich a european harddrug center with 
an estimated 4000 addicts syringes and needles are available free 
and without prescription from doctors and drugstores public 
reaction to the program has been mild

runza fastfood restaurants have something 
mcdonalds burger king and wendys dont cabbage and a cult 
following 
the chain offers hamburgers french fries and other traditional 
fast foods but its the runza sandwich thats the staple at runza 
driveinns of america 
the runza a mixture of ground beef cabbage and onion in an 
oblong loaf of dough is available only in nebraska and three 
neighboring states but its following is devoted 
exnebraskans living in new york are known to order several 
dozen runzas with cheese and italian variations when they hold 
their taste of nebraska parties in the big apple 
new customers often react with disbelief when they learn that 
cabbage is a main ingredient in the runza says chain chief don 
everett 
ninety percent of the people who dont like cabbage normally 
like the product everett said i say to people if you dont 
like it ill give you your money back or ill buy you a 
hamburger 
everett apparently shells out few refunds because his 
lincolnbased chain sold about 15 million worth of runzas last 
year at its 42 restaurants in nebraska iowa kansas and colorado 
its franchises have reported overall sales increases every year 
since runza driveinns of america was incorporated in 1966 everett 
said but the runzas roots stretch back to 18thcentury russia 
germans who were invited to settle in the volga region by 
czarina catherine the great in 1763 developed the runza or bierock 
said ruth amen of the american historical society of germans from 
russia 
a century later many of the germans migrated from russia to the 
americas because of a change in russian leadership 
our people when they came from russia brought the runza with 
them she said i cant say and i dont think anyone can say 
whether they picked them up from the russian people 
everett picked up the runza from his mother sarah sally 
everett who learned how to bake runzas from her mother on a farm 
near sutton 
mrs everetts brother alex brening and her brotherinlaw 
milan everett found themselves looking for work shortly after 
world war ii with an investment of about 500 the three opened 
the first runza restaurant in 1950 
mrs everett and brening still own the original runza but they 
sold the trade name rights to don everett in 1966 
a subsidiary runza national has franchised 42 of the 
restaurants everett said thirtysix of the restaurants are in 
nebraska three are in kansas two in iowa and one in colorado 
everett a major stockholder in about half the restaurants has 
enough franchise applications on file to expand the chain rapidly 
but he said runza driveinns will only grow as quickly as qualified 
owners and managers are found 
we have more than 1400 applications but we dont give them 
serious consideration because they dont have qualified managers to 
send here for training he said 
if a franchise application receives initial approval the 
applicant or a designated store manager must come to runzas 
lincoln headquarters for 50 hours of training 
the franchise is not awarded until the training period which 
includes working in runza restaurants is successfully completed 
everett said 
kathi krause started working at everetts first runza driveinn 
in 1972 at age 16 as a 1 per hour carhop today shes a major 
stockholder in nine runza restaurants 
in states other than nebraska mrs krause admits runzas can be 
a hard sell 
its kind of been a wordofmouth recipe that people in 
nebraska have really grown accustomed to she said outside 
nebraska weve had to work a little harder to let people know what 
they are

as eastern airlines pilots union fought in court 
to stop the transfer of the carriers northeast shuttle the leader 
of the nations unionized pilots said the takeover of eastern 
routes by a small lowcost cargo company could lead to 
industrywide action 
henry duffy national chairman of the air line pilots 
association said easterns plan to let tiny orion air operate 
eastern planes out of atlanta could draw full labor reaction 
pilots all over the united states will see this as a threat to 
the professions duffy told the miami herald in a story published 
today if one company could get away with this other companies 
with like minds could duplicate it 
us rep cardiss collins dill will hold hearings tuesday in 
washington over orions proposed provision of pilots and crews to 
operate 26 planes out of atlanta starting april 1 the pilots 
would receive onethird the pay now earned by easterns crews 
according to details made public of the contract with orion 
eastern unions see the orion deal as both a way for the 
moneylosing carrier to lower costs and to keep operating during a 
strike 
meanwhile us district judge barrington d parker in 
washington on thursday signed an order to expedite the pilots 
legal effort to stop the shuttle transfer and managements 
countereffort to move the transfer along 
he set an april 12 hearing the order also included requirement 
of a 10day notice to the pilots and court before any transfer of 
the shuttle meaning the shuttle transfer couldnt come before 
april 22 
texas air criticized a pilots press release that said eastern 
was barred from the shuttle transfer until court ruling 
alpa the air line pilots association has issued a 
misleading preposterous release they are up to their old 
tricks texas air spokesman bruce hicks said from houston 
hicks said the court order was a joint agreement among eastern 
its parent company and the pilots and that it would allow 
management to keep its original schedule of midapril for making 
the eastern shuttle a separate entity he said the agreement mainly 
set up a schedule for depositions and filings in the discovery or 
evidencegathering phase of the case 
eastern had asked the court to dismiss the pilots challenge so 
it could go ahead with the shuttle transfer 
texas air outraged easterns labor leaders last week by 
announcing the profitable bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle would 
become a texas air division called airshuttle 
the pilots union last year filed suit seeking to block any 
transfer of easterns assets 
texas air last year made easterns reservations system a 
separate entity and transferred or sold some aircraft gates and 
routes to continental airlines also owned by texas air and other 
carriers 
unilateral dismemberment by texas air corp management of 
eastern airlines will not be tolerated said capt jack bavis 
chairman of the eastern pilots union the shuttle is not gone 
and we will fight to keep it within eastern using every available 
resource 
were confident that judge parker will agree with eastern 
pilots that a unilateral eastern air shuttle transfer is unlawful 
and nothing more than a unionbusting tool bavis said in a 
prepared statement 
alpa contends the sale of the shuttle service violates the 
federal railway labor act by changing the working conditions of 
eastern pilots without collective bargaining and undermining alpas 
collective bargaining status 
new york attorney james linsey representing the pilots said he 
would seek eastern and texas air internal memos and also will ask 
during depositions of eastern and texas air officers about plans 
for any more asset transfers such as latin american routes 
significant transfers of aircraft to other airlines 
then we proceed to court for an injunction to prohibit the 
systematic dissection and dismantling of eastern airlines linsey

a majority of mexicos creditor banks have 
given the government permission to go ahead with a new proposal to 
swap some of its enormous foreign debt for special bonds the 
treasury department said 
at the same time it announced that the first auction of the 
bonds had been tentatively set for feb 26 a week later than 
initially planned 
in new york jp morgan amp co the exchange agent of the deal 
said in a statement thursday that the deadline was extended by a 
week in response to requests from numerous banks to prepare their 
bids 
under the program the government plans to exchange some of the 
debt it owes foreign commercial bankers for new 20year bonds that 
will be issued by the government 
the mexican bonds will be backed by 10 billion worth of special 
securities to be issued early this year by the us government 
mexico is expected to pay about 2 billion for the 20year us 
zero coupon bonds which pay no interest but are issued at a sharp 
discount of their face value 
in a statement released late wednesday the mexican treasury 
department said it asked its approximately 600 creditor banks 
permission to offer the bonds because provisions in the loan 
contracts bar it from giving preferences in the repayment of the 
debts 
it received majority approval on feb 5 it said 
even so it said the fact that the banks have expressed 
agreement so that the bonds can be issued does not imply a 
commitment on their part to take part in the auction 
jose angel gurria the nations chief debt negotiator said 300 
banks had given their authorization for mexico to go ahead with the 
auction 
the program would apply to 51 billion of the countrys total 
foreign debt of about 105 billion the second highest in the 
developing world after brazil 
some major us banks reportedly plan to shun the auction 
because they are unhappy that mexico will continue obtaining loans 
at 100 percent of their value while paying back through the bond 
program its old loans at about half their value 
they also are reluctant to accept losses of 50 percent or so on 
the loans entered into years ago 
gurria in an interview with the government newspaper el 
nacional shrugged off the banks concerns 
it doesnt worry us he said the banks should make 
their decision and quote it no one pressures them nor suggests a 
price to them 
we are not negotiating he said they are taking their 
position and they will declare it in a sealed envelope 
when government officials open the bids he said those that 
please us most we take and those that dont no the auction 
mechanism eliminates negotiations 
he said the government has no preconceived idea about prices 
or levels we have a totally open mind because we are entering 
new ground nothing will happen if the offers in the auction are 
not accepted 
government officials have said previously that if they dont 
consider the bids good enough they may well not accept any 
under the program banks would exchange their old debt for the 
new bonds letting mexico recover 52 cents or so for each dollar in 
the secondary market that means that mexico could retire part of 
its debt for half its face value 
by reducing its debt the government will also cut the amount of 
interest it pays each year on the loans mexico was scheduled to 
pay an estimated 8 billion to 9 billion in interest charges in 
1987

a federal judge has turned down federated department stores 
incs request to dismiss campeau corps challenge of a delaware 
antitakeover law while the federal government has indicated it 
might intervene in the case 
in another development thursday torontobased campeau disclosed 
more financing details for a proposed 54 billion merger with 
cincinnatibased federated the merger was offered as an 
alternative to its outstanding 42 billion hostile tender offer 
we believe that the federated board cannot consistent with 
its fiduciary responsibilities to stockholders continue to refuse 
to meet with us campeau chairman robert campeau said in a letter 
to federated chairman howard goldfede 
federated had no comment on campeaus renewed offer federated 
spokesman jim sluzewski said 
the securities and exchange commission submitted a brief 
thursday supporting campeaus right to challenge the delaware 
statute the sec also indicated it might express an opinion on the 
merits of the suit itself 
us district judge leonard b sand in new york had asked the 
sec for comment on federateds motion to dismiss campeaus suit 
federated which is incorporated in delaware contended campeau had 
no standing to make the constitutional challenge because it did not 
have assured financing for its hostile takeover bid 
but the sec indicated the substantial efforts and 
expenditures undertaken by a party making a tender offer 
satisfied the requirement that a party have a personal stake in 
an issue in order to have standing to sue 
the brief also stated campeau could suffer substantial 
injury if forced to wait for assurance of financing before 
pressing its lawsuit and such assurance would do little or nothing 
to clarify the constitutional issues in the case 
campeau challeged the takeover law as an unconstitutional 
interference with interstate commerce and an infringement on 
federal regulatory authority 
the law is regarded as significant because of the thousands of 
major companies that have incorporated in delaware black amp decker 
corp which has a 203 billion hostile offer outstanding for 
american standard inc also has challenged the law 
eric summergrad the sec assistant general counsel said in 
washington the agencys staff also was considering a similar 
friend of the court brief addressing the actual issues raised 
by the suit he said a decision on whether to file such a brief 
should be made in the next two weeks 
campeau also has filed suit to challenge federateds poison 
pill takeover defense but that issue was not addressed by the 
sec brief issued thursday 
federated shares jumped 237 to 5987 a share thursday on 
the new york stock exchange 
campeau further disclosed that it had financing commitments for 
200 million of a planned 500 million bank loan being arranged by 
bank of montreal and banque paribas and a commitment for a 100 
million shortterm bridge loan from first boston corp first 
boston also indicated it was highly confident it could raise up to 
1 billion in subordinated debt to finance the merger 
campeau said in his letter to goldfeder that security pacific 
national bank in los angeles has committed 500 million to the deal 
and has advised us that it is highly confident that commitments 
can be obtained for the balance of the required financing 
campeau on wednesday disclosed it had agreements for 660 
million in financing for its 54 billion offer federated has said 
it would discuss that offer which was applicable only in a 
definitive merger agreement if campeau showed it had enough 
financing to complete the buyout 
ohio shopping center developer edward j debartolo who helped 
finance campeaus 34 billion buyout of allied stores corp in 
1986 agreed to lend 400 million the reichmann family of toronto 
which controls olympia amp york developments ltd a major campeau 
shareholder agreed to buy 260 million in new campeau shares 
federated operates approximately 650 stores nationwide and had 
sales exceeding 11 billion in 1987 
federateds holdings include the new york chains bloomingdales 
and abraham and straus filenes of boston burdines of miami

dart group corp says it will press its 
billiondollar buyout bid for stop amp shop cos despite a unanimous 
rejection of the offer by the stop amp shop board of directors 
our offer is still outstanding dart president robert haft 
said thursday following the rejection of the offer our offer is 
to the 90 percent of the shareholders who are not on the board 
in rejecting the offer the stop amp shop board said the 103 
billion buyout a bid of 37 a share was inadequate and not in the 
best interests of the company or its stockholders 
among the boards considerations was information that dart has 
yet to secure commitments to provide financing for its offer stop 
amp shop said in a statement stop amp shop also said it was exploring 
alternatives to the unsolicited offer including a possible sale of 
the firm 
a company statement said stop amp shop had received indications 
of interest from third parties for a transaction with the company 
but haft said dart was prepared to compete for stop amp shop 
if there is a higher bona fide alternative to our offer we 
intend to bid against it haft said in a telephone interview 
stop amp shop said its other alternatives included exploring a 
leveraged buyout recapitalization or other restructuring in a 
leveraged buyout investors borrow heavily to purchase a company 
and then pay off the debt with the companys cash flow or the sale 
of its assets stop amp shop which operates 141 supermarkets and 171 
bradlees department stores around the country has said publicly it 
prefers to remain independent 
the statement referred to darts history of making millions of 
dollars in profits through failed takeover bids many analysts 
doubt that dart is sincere in wanting to acquire and operate a 
retail company 
haft denied his company had made its offer solely to profit from 
its stop amp shop holdings the dart group has acquired 738220 
shares of stop amp shop 27 percent of the outstanding shares 
haft said dart had begun the process under which it could call a 
special meeting of stop amp shop shareholders for the purpose of 
replacing the companys board with directors more sympathetic to 
the offer 
stop amp shop stock fell 50 cents thursday to 3687 a share in 
new york stock exchange trading announcemennt of the rejection 
came after the close of trading 
haft and his father herbert the chairman of dart had offered 
31 a share for the retailer and earlier this week raised the bid 
to 37 
in hartford conn officials at local 919 of the united food amp 
commercial workers union said thursday they have retained a team 
of lawyers investment bankers and other advisers to explore the 
workers options in the face of the dart bid 
the union also requested a meeting with stop amp shop directors 
we are exploring all and every appropriate alternative to 
protect the interests and jobs of the employees we represent 
said local president arnold f espinosa 
among the options being considered are seeking a white 
knight a suitor sympathetic to the employees interests and an 
employee stock ownership plan in a possible leveraged buyout 
espinosa said 
the hartford local which represents 10000 stop amp shop workers 
is leading the effort on behalf of other locals stop amp shop has a 
total of 35000 workers

a francobelgian deal to keep a 
restructured societe generale de belgique sa in belgian hands fell 
through friday and revitalized a bid by italian investor carlo de 
benedetti to take effective control of the nations biggest holding 
company 
belgian industrialist andre leysen failed to get the necessary 
backing from a group of mostly belgian shareholders to approve a 
deal with the french holding cie financiere de suez to take control 
of societe generale 
leysen said in a statement he considered his mandate as 
spokesman for the group as over he added he would not take new 
initiatives in the fight for control of the company that has a 
stake in a third of the belgian economy 
de benedetti is trying to get effective control of societe 
generale and use it as a platform for a paneuropean financial 
holding company 
the italian investor claims to be the largest single shareholder 
and can control through allies 38 percent of stock in the 
company he has a public offer for 15 percent more 
the 166yearold societe generale has interests in about 1400 
companies worldwide with assets totaling nearly 3 billion 
the group of mostly belgian investors formed around leysen said 
it had 28 percent of stocks in the company while suez claimed 15 
percent 
but together with various small allies leysen said the bloc 
would have been assured of absolute majority at shareholders 
meetings 
the accord was also favored by the current management of societe 
generale which has come under sharp attack by de benedetti 
even before fridays rejection of the leysensuez deal de 
benedetti had offered to cooperate with belgian shareholders in 
restructuring societe generale with a belgian as chief officer and 
himself running the daytoday management 
de benedetti did not extend the offer for cooperation to suez 
however 
a shareholder can block management decisions when he has 25 
percent of societe generale stock 
fridays developments followed a week of frantic negotiations 
between the three interested parties and threatened to defeat de 
benedettis bid to take control of the company 
suez meanwhile said in paris it would continue to negotiate with 
belgian shareholders despite leysens withdrawal 
suez said in a statement the group is continuing discussions 
with all the belgian shareholders that have expressed their desire 
to build a balanced partnership with us

gillette co which has fought off cosmetic giant 
revlon co repeatedly is now being chased by a group led by 
coniston partners 
coniston subsidiary rb partners has accumulated 676 million 
gillette shares or about 58 percent of the companys roughly 
1159 million shares outstanding the group disclosed thursday 
coniston a partnership that was instrumental in the breakup of 
allegis corp indicated it would like to meet with gillette said 
paul e tierney jr coniston general partner 
failing that tierney said coniston may meet with potential 
buyers of gillette stock in an attempt to seek representation for 
the upcoming board of directors annual meeting in april 
we dont want to break up gillette tierney said the 
smartest thing would be to see the company purchased by another 
entity 
coleman mockler gillettes chairman and chief executive said 
in a prepared statement rb partners appears to be trying to 
pressure the gillette directors into putting the company up for 
sale and to stir up renewed speculation in gillette stock 
the directors have consistently stated the view that gillette 
has a bright future as an independent company the statement said 
the coniston group said it acquired the shares because it 
believed they were undervalued coniston also indicated it would 
attempt to meet with gillette management to determine the steps the 
company would take to boost its stock price 
but according to the gillette release the company was satisfied 
that a recent restructuring was sufficiently boosting shareholder 
values and it would not be pressured into giving up its 
independence 
shearson lehman analyst andres shore said if coniston pursued a 
proxy fight against gillette management it might find support in 
the many institutions that hold company stock 
thursdays disclosure came after several days of renewed 
takeover speculation surrounding gillette that sent the consumer 
products companys stock shooting higher 
gillette rose 362 to 41 a share in active new york stock 
exchange trading thursday 
the group stated it might meet with potential acquirers to 
determine their interest in buying gillette and to compare the 
price they might offer against the benefits of a management plan 
bostonbased gillette long has been the object of takeover 
speculation over the past two years the company has spurned 
several takeover offers from revlon group inc the latest a 541 
billion proposal 
the companies signed a standstill agreement in november 1986 
after revlon acquired a 14 percent take in gillette and made its 
initial unsuccessful offer for a 412 billion buyout the pact 
prohibits revlon from launching a tender offer without the consent 
of gillettes board of directors which adamantly has opposed 
takeover overtures 
after rebuffing revlon in 1986 gillette undertook a 
restructuring that included layoffs of about 2400 workers and the 
sale of a number of its smaller businesses 
last november the company announced a reorganization that split 
it into two main units one for its north american and european 
razor razor blade personal products and stationary products 
businesses and the other for international and diversified units 
conistons moves indicated it believed gillette was worth more 
than the stock market had valued it and the group might realize a 
bigger profit from the proceeds of a buyout breakup or other 
restructuring than it would from a longterm rise in the companys 
stock price 
keith gollust a general partner in the group declined to 
identify the parties deemed potential buyers for gillette although 
rumored acquirers in the past have included the british 
conglomerate hanson trust plc and unilever nv the anglodutch 
consumer products company

now that wall street has been in a bear market 
for nearly six months some venturesome investors are searching out 
cheap stocks to buy 
of course just about all the merchandise a stockbroker has to 
offer has been marked down significantly since last summer but 
some stocks may upon appraisal look cheaper than others 
how to identify them one handy way is to plug several 
statistical measures into a computer program and instruct the 
machine to search the market for stocks that meet those criteria 
norman weinger and michael metz analysts at the investment firm 
of oppenheimer amp co who are well known on wall street for screens 
of this type have just completed one 
they found deep discount stocks predominating in electric 
utilities banking insurance savings and loans and some 
householdname blue chips as well 
no investment decision is warranted on the basis of these 
figures alone they caution if a stock is out of favor there 
are likely to be excellent reasons why 
the data should be used as a starting point in a quest for 
unusually attractive values weinger and metz say 
the analysts set three standards for a stock to qualify as 
deeply discounted 
its priceearnings ratio had to be at least onethird below 
the average for the market as a whole as measured by standard amp 
poors index of 400 industrials 
it must carry a dividend yield at least onethird more than 
the sampp 400 
the ratio of its stock price to book value or theoretical 
worth if the company were to be liquidated had to be at least 
onethird below the aggregate ratio for the sampp 400 
the two biggest names that showed up on weinger and metzs 
screen were general motors and sears roebuck prime examples of 
companies that clearly would be affected by any slowdown in 
consumer spending the analysts noted 
also conspicuous by its presence is merrill lynch reflecting 
the depressed state of the securities industry 
numerous banking concerns also made the leastloved list thanks 
if that is the right word to worries about loans in third world 
countries and in real estate and energy deals that investors are 
worried about 
representatives from the insurance industry include such 
prominent participants as aetna cigna continental and travelers 
from the savings and loan group hf ahmanson calfed and great 
western financial 
and then there are no less than 57 utilities from atlantic 
energy to pacificorp 
this is weinger and metz say an industry undergoing 
significant change perhaps the most important change is that 
capital requirements eg for new plants and other facilities 
are tending to flatten or decline 
as a result some utilities are becoming net cash generators 
rather than the insatiable consumers of capital they were in the 
1970s 
it is estimated that the industry in aggregate will be able to 
cover its capital requirements entirely from internal cash 
generation by 1989 this development has favorable implications for 
the industrys investment status 
improving debttoequity ratios could provide the basis for an 
upward valuation of the group enabling utility companies to pay 
out a larger proportion of reported earnings in dividends 
the group may command considerably greater investment interest 
as a result of the recent market decline and greater concern about 
prospects for continued economic growth

the us trade deficit narrowed to 122 
billion in december the smallest gap since january as exports hit 
a record the commerce department said today 
for the year the trade deficit widened to 1712 billion the 
largest ever but financial markets were expected to pay more 
attention to the december numbers which came two months after the 
oct 19 stock market crash 
decembers merchandise trade deficit of 122 billion was an 
improvement from the 132 billion gap posted in november 
decembers deficit the smallest since januarys 119 billion 
shortfall was paced by a record 248 billion in exports a 42 
percent improvement over november novembers gain had also 
resulted from surging exports 
imports meanwhile were at 37 billion in december the same 
level as in the previous month 
still for the year the differnce between what the united 
states imported and what it exported soared 96 percent from the 
previous record deficit of 1562 billion in 1986 
for all of 1987 imports totaled 4241 billion and exports 
totaled 2529 billion up from imports of 383 billion and 
exports of 2268 billion in 1986 
the reagan administration was quick to hail the new numbers 
trade representative clayton k yeutter said the drop in the 
deficit is good news particularly since this is the second 
straight monthly decline we hope this is a sign that there are 
better days ahead on the trade front 
jay goldinger economist for cantor fitzgerald a los angeles 
bond brokerage said the trade figures demonstrate we are in the 
middle of a major change in course on the balanceoftrade 
but its a big ship and you dont turn it on a dime but at 
least we know were headed home goldinger said 
exports have been climbing in recent months under pressure from 
a weaker dollar which makes us goods more competitive abroad 
while driving up the price of imports 
government and private economists have suggested that an export 
boom could be the major factor in finally bringing down the trade 
deficit which has been increasing steadily since the late 1970s 
the united states continued to run its largest deficit with 
japan 598 billion in 1987 up from 586 billion in 1986 
the deficit with western europe however narrowed to 302 
billion from 327 billion the deficit with taiwan increased to 
190 billion from 157 billion and with canada it was down to 
117 billion from 132 billion 
the deficit with south korea in 1987 was 99 billion up from 
71 billion in 1986 with hong kong it was up to 65 billion 
from 64 billion and with mexico the us trade shortfall rose 
to 59 billion from 52 billion in 1986 
for december alone the trade defcit with japan was 48 
billion about the same as november with western europe 27 
billion up from 24 billion with canada 6328 million down 
from 13 billion with taiwan 11 billion down from 12 
billion with south korea 7628 million up from 7602 million 
imports for all of 1987 were up 107 percent while exports rose 
115 percent that compares to an 87 percent rise in imports in 
1986 and only a 37 percent rise in exports 
for the full year imports of manufactured goods rose to 3252 
billion from 2938 billion oil imports surged to 448 billion 
from 376 billion 
meanwhile exports of us manufactured goods were up to 1715 
billion from 1487 billion in 1986 
in agricultural goods one of the few categories where the 
united states maintained a trade surplus exports were up to 286 
billion from 261 billion in 1987 
new car imports from japan were 20 billion in december the 
same level as in november for the year car imports from japan 
totaled 222 billion up slightly from 220 billion in 1986 
new auto imports from canada were 10 billion in december down 
from 12 billion in november and 102 billion for the year 
down from 118 billion in 1986 
from other countries auto imports were 16 billion up from 
15 billion in november and 168 billion for all of 1987 up 
from 127 billion 
the monthly trade figures which governmment analysts caution 
can be misleading because they are not adjusted for either seasonal 
factors or inflation have become one of the most closely watched 
set of government statistics by financial markets 
in fact the task force appointed by president reagan to study 
the market collapse identified a weakerthanexpected trade report 
released in early october as one factor triggering the 508point 
stock price plunge 
a weaker dollar can help ease the us trade deficit by making 
imports more expensive and us goods more competitive abroad but 
reports of a smaller trade deficit tend to raise the value of the 
dollar which in turn can cause the deficit to widen 
the reagan administration in past months has joined with its 
major economic allies in seeking a stable dollar against other key 
currencies too rapid a fall in the value of the dollar can produce 
inflation 
the dollar has fallen 50 percent since mid1985 against the 
japanese yen and key european currencies

toyota motor sales usa is working on a plan that 
could result in the export of small airplanes to the far east a 
company official says 
brian barents a toyota vice president hired recently from 
cessna aircraft co of wichita kan said the potential deal would 
help reduce the us trade imbalance with the far east 
the government announced today that its deficit with japan for 
last year rose to 598 billion from 586 billion in 1986

said from company headquarters in torrance calif 
toyota officials said the deal would involve the export of 
planes made by cessna a subsidiary of general dynamics corp 
barents in a story published in todays detroit free press 
declined to say how many airplanes would be involved or when export 
would begin 
he said the plan called for toyota to export cessnas largest 
airplanes including corporate jets

prices the government said today 
the rise in the labor departments producer price index negated 
a 04 percent decline in december and was the steepest monthly 
increase since an identical 04 percent jump in september 
januarys rise if it persisted for 12 months would amount to 
an annual inflation rate of 46 percent compared with the 22 
percent increase for all of 1987 economists however still expect 
that wholesale prices will moderate through the balance of 1988 
food prices increased 17 percent in january rebounding from a 
14 percent decline in december 
analysts said an insect infestation in california and arizona 
pushed up vegetable prices while cold weather influenced a rise in 
chicken and pork prices 
the increase included a 162 percent surge vegetable prices 
lettuce shot up 516 percent in janaury that comes atop a 105 
percent increase in december and a 954 percent jump in november 
celery rocketed 441 percent and onions 325 percent 
prices for pork were up 132 percent egg costs jumped 125 
percent chicken prices went up 56 percent 
costs also rose for rice macaroni products and fish declines 
were posted for turkeys off 124 percent and fresh fruits down 
30 percent 
natural gas prices edged up 08 percent after a 30 percent 
increase in december but steep declines were recorded for other 
forms of energy which overall fell 45 percent compared with a 
decline of 16 percent a month earlier 
gasoline prices fell 84 percent after dropping 42 percent in 
december home heating oil costs dropped 62 percent compared with 
a 52 percent fall a month before 
donald ratajczak who runs his own inflation surveys as director 
of economic forecasting at georgia state university in atlanta 
said falling energy prices reflect a little bit of a glut on 
the oil market 
the industry historically takes a long time to adjust its 
production to price changes and there is still some overproduction 
stemming from oil price increases in the early 1980s he said 
minus the usually volatile food and energy categories the index 
for all other finished goods rose a brisk 05 percent compared 
with a 02 percent increase in december 
ratajczak said this figure was pushed higher by publishers of 
newspapers and magazines and producers of items sold through 
catalogs who tend to raise their prices once at the beginning of 
each year 
the labor department gave these other specifics on january 
wholesale price activity 
new automobile prices were up 02 percent following a 19 
percent drop in december 
alcoholic beverage costs were up 01 percent after a 03 
percent increase a month earlier 
household appliance prices were down 02 percent compared with 
an 02 percent increase in december 
home electronic equipment costs fell 02 percent after dropping 
05 percent earlier 
gains were also posted for adults and childrens clothing and 
shoes 
the figures are adjusted to remove predictable seasonal price 
fluctuations 
the wholesale price calculation excludes services and imports 
areas of the economy where price increases have been more rapid in 
part because of the falling dollar which makes foreign products 
more expensive 
the consumer price index which tracks prices at the retail 
level and includes services and imports is due out feb 26 for 
january inflation at the consumer level was 44 percent in 1987 
the january increase left the overall producer price index 
which is not seasonally adjusted at 1062 percent of its 1982 
baseperiod average 
that means that a selection of goods costing 10 in 1982 cost 
1062 last month up from 1057 in december and 1040 in january 
1987 
the government used the 1982 base for the first time in the 
january report it had used a 1967 base since 1971 a selection of 
goods that cost 10 in 1967 cost 2980 last month up from 2968 
in december and 2918 in january 1987 
the labor department with the january report also revised its 
seasonal adjustments for the past five years changing previously 
reported percent changes in many categories 
michael evans president of his own economic consulting firm in 
washington said a modest rebound in wholesale inflation may spook 
the bond market and send longterm interest rates up 
but lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group a 
philadelphiaarea forecasting service said the markets will be 
looking more closely at december trade deficit figures also 
released this morning 
generally speaking inflation is still pretty mild 
chimerine said 
ratajczak predicts moderate wholesale inflation of 26 percent 
for 1988 and a more robust 39 percent in 1989 
the major thrust of the 1988 increase is higher farm 
prices especially for the grains and a slight increase in 
energy prices he said our current estimates suggest 
that reacceleration of significant inflationary pressures may 
develop in 1989 as oil prices rise

an agreement has been reached between union 
construction crews and amoco corp ending a fourmonth labor 
dispute at the whiting ind refinery 
a union official said thursday the chicagobased oil company had 
agreed to use only union contractors in return the unions agreed 
to call off picketing and a campaign calling for a union consumer 
boycott of amocos gas stations 
g russell bassett president of the northwest indiana building 
and construction trades council said the chicagobased oil company 
agreed to use only union contractors for any refinery construction 
work in the future 
the dispute began in october when amoco hired nonunion 
contractors for 10 million worth of construction and renovation 
work at the 99yearold refinery the work was completed recently 
despite the presence of union picket lines 
more than 55 people were arrested and several were injured 
during the first days of the picketing which drew as many as 1000 
union members 
in a move to put economic pressure on amoco the unions withdrew 
at least 100 million in funds from chicago banks that had amoco 
executives on their boards of directors bassett said redepositing 
of that money was not part of the settlement worked out with the 
company 
resolution of the dispute came several days after members of the 
oil chemical and atomic workers union endorsed a twoyear contract 
covering the whiting refinery and other amoco installations around 
the country 
all parties are gratified with the settlement and are looking 
forward to a resumption of work amoco said in a statement 
thursday

the nations deficit in foreign trade stood at a 
lowerthanexpected 122 billion in december while business 
inventories jumped the government said today it also said 
wholesale prices rose a brisk 04 percent in january 
the trade figure was the lowest in 11 months reflecting a surge 
in exports commerce department officials said 
for the year the trade deficit widened to a record 1712 
billion the largest ever but financial markets were expected to 
pay more attention to the december numbers which came two months 
after the oct 19 stock market crash 
meanwhile the labor department said higher food costs more than 
offset declines in energy prices last month easily wiping out a 
04 percent decline in decembers producer price index 
it was the steepest monthly increase since an identical 04 
percent jump in september and would amount to an annual inflation 
rate of 46 percent if it persisted all year the annual rate of 
increase for all of 1987 was 22 percent 
analysts still expect that wholesale prices will moderate 
through the balance of 1988 however 
in another report the commerce department said business 
inventories shot up 08 percent in december the third consecutive 
large monthly advance 
the december increase pushed unsold stockpiles on shelves and 
backlots up by 545 billion to a seasonally adjusted 70187 
billion the increase followed even larger gains of 09 percent in 
november and 11 percent in october 
while the economy as measured by the gross national product 
expanded at a brisk 42 percent annual rate in the final three 
months of the year nearly threefourths of that growth came from 
an unusually large buildup in inventories which was occurring at 
the same time that consumer spending was falling 
because of this combination many analysts believe growth in the 
first three months of 1988 will be extremely sluggish with some 
analysts even forecasting one quarter of negative gnp growth 
on thursday the commerce department said retail sales activity 
posted its third monthly increase in january as a rebound in auto 
sales boosted the key economic sector 
some economists said januarys 05 percent rise in retail sales 
reflected a continued recovery in consumer confidence that was 
jarred during the october stock market crash 
in addition to the january rise the government revised upward 
the sales gains reported for the two previous months sales were up 
a strong 12 percent in december and 03 percent in november 
compared with previous estimates of 07 percent and 01 percent 
respectively 
because consumer spending accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity analysts have been watching it closely for signs 
of a slowdown in the wake of the crash 
but although januarys gains were supported by a 16 percent 
rise in auto sales some analysts said the figures were strong 
enough to indicate consumers were not dragging the economy into a 
recession 
sales had declined by a sharp 09 percent in october and 17 
percent in september 
retail establishments sold 1281 billion worth of goods in 
january up 600 million from december the government said it was 
the highest monthly total since august when sales hit 1289 
billion 
a separate government report indicated severely cold weather 
boosted americans home heating bills by nearly a halfbillion 
dollars in january 
the survey by the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration indicated home heating cost americans 998 billion 
in january 470 million more than if weather for the month had 
been average 
that means the typical home owner or renter spent 13880 on 
oil gas or electricity to keep warm last month 654 more than 
the bill would have been in a normal january 
costs vary considerably across the country but bills were above 
normal in every area except the pacific coast according to the 
monthly report 
in other economic news on thursday a selective midwinter review 
of the farm labor situation by the agriculture department showed 
there were about 11 percent more hired workers on the job than a 
year ago 
a quarterly report showed about 340000 workers hired by farmers 
were on the job during a survey in the week jan 1016 compared 
with 307000 a year earlier

leaders of the 12nation european 
economic community looked for a way out of the trading blocs 
financial crisis during an emergency summit today 
the twoday summit which began thursday stalled for several 
hours through the morning as west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the summmit chairman met separately with several leaders the 
meeting resumed midafternoon 
the summit adjourned within minutes of the morning opening after 
france and germany threw out proposals for relatively stringent 
curbs on the trade blocs runaway farm spending after seeing 
detailed costings drawn up overnight by officials 
france seeking less painful measures for its farmers as the 
spring presidential election looms declared it could yield no 
more while british prime minister margaret thatcher and dutch 
premier ruud lubbers held out for austerity 
through most of the morning the leaders sat around in groups 
with their foreign ministers in the main conference room at the eec 
headquarters chatting informally 
kohl striving to head off a third successive eec summit failure 
in eight months met separately with french premier jacques chirac 
lubbers mrs thatcher and spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez 
on the steep and difficult climb toward the summit there is a 
dense fog and some people have lost their way west german 
government spokesman friedhelm ost told reporters 
he said kohl wanted a success but not a success at any 
price 
earlier french agriculture minister francois guillaume said in 
a french radio interview that france has no more to give on the 
agriculture issue 
when you reach a certain moment you have to know how to say 
no said guillaume 
dutch spokesman nicjan jonker told reporters it is wrong to 
assume that the netherlands will give in 
in paris angry farmers today plowed furrows in the champ de 
mars a park near the eiffel tower to protest some eec members 
proposals for cuts in farm spending 
about 50 people participated in the demonstration they dug 
several furrows then left peacefully when police arrived shortly 
after noon 
european leaders argued late into the night thursday in an 
effort to reach agreement on a number of issues kohl urged them to 
forget their national interests saying national goitalone 
policies are doomed to fail now 
the common market members are grappling with these interrelated 
issues 
curbing agriculture spending that totaled 338 billion last 
year or twothirds of the total eec budget 
raising funds for regional development in the eecs poorest 
areas of spain portugal greece and ireland 
devising a new eec funding formula based on the relative wealth 
of each member state which now contribute 14 percent of their 
sales taxes 
two previous summits failed to produce agreement on any of these 
issues lacking a 1988 budget the community is now operating at 
last years funding levels 
britain and the netherlands want the eecs farm spending to be 
raised by 625000 in 1988 france and west germany both with 
politically powerful farming lobbies have sought an increase of 
31 billion 
france also wants production of cereals a commodity already in 
gross oversupply to be held at 160 million tons annually as 
opposed to 155 million tons as demanded by the dutch and the 
british 
if we accede to the french we face severe trade problems 
with the united states and other producers it is not a budgetary 
issue dutch foreign minister hans van den broek told reporters 
after the summits first day 
but france joined the rich northern countries to defeat 
proposals for nearly doubling the 88 billion allowance for 
regional development britain and other northern nations seek an 
increase of just 50 percent

belgiums largest bank friday announced 
it entered a banking alliance with one of the biggest dutch 
banks to form a major european financial group 
the dutch amro bank and the belgian generale de banque sa will 
try to set up an integrated multinational banking group within 
three years said generale de banques chairman eric de villegas 
de clercamp 
officials said the two banks launched the venture by acquiring 
partial ownership of each other and by putting funds into a joint 
holding company tuba holding international bv 
each of the two partners has a 50 percent capital stake in tuba 
which will be managed on a joint basis 
de villegas de clercamp denied that the agreement had been made 
with amro to head off a possible bid by italian investor carlo de 
benedetti who is trying to take effective control of societe 
generale de belgique sa belgiums biggest holding company 
societe generale has a 134 percent stake in generale de banque 
de villegas de clercamp acknowledged however that the battle 
for control of societe generale gave rise to the feeling that the 
banks clients trust and confidence may have been shaken 
he said societe generale which has three seats on the banks 
board had given general approval for the project but when it 
came to a vote the three representatives had abstained for 
personal reasons he did not elaborate 
deposits of generale de banque amounted to 52047 billion while 
amro banks deposits 58343 billion based on 1986 statistics 
the generale de banque chairman said the two banks were forming 
the alliance to prepare for the intense competition which must be 
faced after 1992 
the european economic community has targeted that year for a 
complete end to barriers in the exchange of goods capital and 
trade among the 12 member nations

major us banks arent expected to participate in 
mexicos innovative debtreduction plan an american banker said 
friday 
a senior official at swiss bank corp however said his bank 
will tender some of its loans 
the bankers made their comments at a london conference on latin 
america organized by the international herald tribune and the 
interamerican development bank 
under the program the mexican government plans to exchange some 
of the debt it owes foreign commercial banks for new 20year bonds 
that will be issued by the government and backed by us treasury 
bonds 
mexican officials have indicated they expect to retire 20 
billion of debt through the 10 billion bond issue the country has 
1056 billion in total outstanding debt 
in a statement released late wednesday the mexican treasury 
department said it asked its approximately 600 creditor banks 
permission to offer the bonds and that it received majority 
approval on feb 5 
but richard marin a senior vice president at bankers trust co 
told the conference i do not believe any major us banks will 
tender their loans under the mexican plan 
us banks have provisions equal to about 25 percent of their 
third world loan exposure and this wont cover the 50 percent 
discount at which mexico expects the banks to swap their loans 
marin said 
marin indicated that the mexican plan to swap loans for new 
bonds is designed for smaller us regional banks that wish to dump 
their mexican exposure 
franz lutolf general manager at swiss bank corp said his bank 
will submit a bid and called the plan a step in the right 
direction 
lutolf wouldnt say at what discount his bank would tender its 
loans but indicated it would be above 50 percent of face value 
fifty percent wont fly he said 
an official at swiss bank corp in basel who refused to be 
identified said the bank plans to tender about onethird of its 
mexican loans but wouldnt say how large its exposure is 
the official said swiss banks must have provisions equal to at 
least 35 percent of their third world exposure and that his bank is 
comfortably above that level 
auction of the bonds had been tentatively set for feb 26 a 
week later than initially planned

canadas merchandise trade surplus shrank to 208 
million canadian dollars in december or about 164 million the 
lowest monthly surplus since september 1981 statistics canada said 
friday 
the december surplus down from a revised 402 million canadian 
dollars in november left the full years surplus at the lowest 
level in seven years 
the 1987 surplus totaled 103 billion canadian dollars or about 
81 billion down marginally from 104 billion canadian dollars in 
1986 the agency said 
the surplus with the united states canadas most important 
trading partner declined to 17 billion canadian dollars from 184 
billion canadian dollars in 1986 those numbers are reconciled with 
the united states 
paul kovacs senior economist at the burns fry investment house 
in toronto said he had expected 1987 would have ended with a much 
stronger trade surplus the result of canada exporting more goods 
than it imported 
we clearly had a deteriorating trend at the end of the year 
which is disturbing said kovacs 
exports grew by 41 per cent in 1987 from the previous year 
rising to 1258 billion canadian dollars largely on strong foreign 
sales of forest products 
however imports increased at the slightly quicker pace of 47 
per cent during the year to reach 1154 billion canadian dollars by 
year end 
meanwhile the trade deficit with japan the no 2 trading 
partner fell to 691 million canadian dollars from more than 16 
billion canadian dollars the year before 
statistics canada said the rise in exports was mainly the result 
of an increase of 32 billion canadian dollars in forestproduct 
sales that came despite export taxes canada was forced to impose on 
softwood lumber because of american action 
however foreign sales of automotive products from canada fell 
by 22 billion canadian dollars to 32 billion canadian dollars 
merchandise trade is only about half of canadas total trade 
picture with the rest coming in service sectors such as tourism 
shipping and consulting

gov tommy thompson asked wisconsins 
attorney general today to prepare a lawsuit against chrysler corp 
because of its plans to close its automaking plant in kenosha 
wis but left open the possibility of a settlement 
thompson said it was possible an agreement could be reached with 
chrysler before the issue actually goes to court 
asked about the odds of the matter actually ending up in court 
thompson replied i dont want to engage in a percentage at 
this time 
the governor stressed that in such matters it is always 
desirable to negotiate before going to court 
that would certainly spare the trauma it would be better off 
for both parties to settle without going to court he said 
the attorney general has advised me that we do have a good 
and winnable case said thompson who was joined at a news 
conference by attorney general don hanaway 
thompson said it could be some time before the suit is filed 
over chryslers decision to lay off 5500 workers in kenosha 
he said he talked tuesday with chrysler chairman lee iacocca and 
would meet later with other chrysler officials he declined to say 
where or when the meeting would occur 
the lawsuit is a type of thing that can be won in several 
ways thompson said 
the governor said he has asked hanaway to check with local 
government officials in kenosha and with united auto workers union 
local 72 at the chrysler plant there to see if they want to join in 
the lawsuit 
thompson repeated his contention that chryslers decision to 
abandon automaking in kenosha was political and not economic 
he said omnihorizon cars were being produced at kenosha 
efficiently and were of the highest quality 
there is no reason he said for chrysler not to live up 
to what the state contends was an agreement by the automaker to 
produce the cars at the plant for five years 
all of us at chrysler are very sorry that the plant had to be 
closed we also feel very deeply for the pain and suffering of 
the workers and community chrysler motors chairman gerald 
greenwald said at a news conference in chicago after thompsons 
announcement 
i guess you could say chrysler was overly optimistic when it 
told workers and government officials in wisconsin that it believed 
it could build the omnihorizon small car at kenosha for up to five 
years greenwald said 
but we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no 
grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie he said 
greenwald said chrysler will repay the city and county of 
kenosha more than 1 million the governments spent on improvements 
for the plant 
my position is the retention of 5500 jobs for five years 
thompson said those jobs dont necessarily have to be automobile 
jobs they could be other manufacturing jobs 
hanaway said it had not been decided precisely what wisconsin 
would seek in the suit but he said the state probably would ask 
the court for an injunction to delay the layoffs 
thompson asked if defense contracts for the plant might be 
something the state would go after replied i think that is a 
possibility 
in fiscal year 1987 chrysler corp and three subsidiaries

million 
in the first two months of fiscal 1988 the contractors won 11 
million in contracts

the dollar jumped higher against most major 
foreign currencies in moderate european trading friday following 
news that the us trade deficit shrank to 122 billion in 
december from 132 billion the previous month 
gold prices also moved up 
the dollar surged quickly after the trade figures were reported 
but profittaking pushed it back somewhat 
the dollar finished with a gain of almost two cents against the 
british pound and more than two pfennigs against the west german 
mark it also gained more than two yen against the japanese yen 
but that increase was spread over two days because thursday was a 
national holiday in japan 
it was a good trade number said one london dealer but 
overall its still too early to say the dollar has turned a 
corner 
dealers were heartened by the news that exports rose 42 percent 
to a record 248 billion while imports were unchanged at 37 
billion 
the report also showed the deficit with japan narrowed to 479 
billion from 485 billion 
however dealers said they are reserving judgment on the 
dollars upside potential until monday when japanese trade data 
for january will be released 
a significant reduction in the us trade deficit with japan 
would support the dollars bullish undertone dealers said 
the dollar rose above 130 japanese yen for the first time since 
middecember trading at 13115 yen in london up from 12995 
earlier in tokyo and up from 12903 yen in tokyo on wednesday 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late rates 
thursday included 17123 west german marks up from 16885 
14065 swiss francs up from 13870 57865 french francs up from 
57135 19225 dutch guilders up from 18961 126075 italian 
lire up from 124665 and 12624 canadian dollars down from 
12663 
the british pound fell to 17401 from 17595 late thursday 
gold rose in london to a late bid price of 443 a troy ounce 
compared with late thursdays 44150 
in zurich gold was higher closing at a bid 44350 compared 
with 441 late thursday 
earlier the metal closed in hong kong at a bid of 44369 down 
from 44393 
silver bullion prices rose on the london market where the metal 
was trading at a late bid price of 634 a troy ounce compared 
with 631 late thursday

toymaker mattel inc on friday posted 
losses of 1007 million for the fourth quarter and 1132 million 
for the year with virtually all the red ink accounted for by 
restructuring costs 
the maker of barbie dolls hot wheels and other toys also 
disclosed it has trimmed its headquarters staff by 22 percent over 
the last year to 1720 workers from 2200 
mattels troubles reflect a malaise in the toy industry that 
persisted through much of last year 
the companys 1007 million deficit for the three months ended 
dec 26 compared with a loss of 269 million the previous year 
revenue was off by 14 percent to 2338 million from 2719 million 
the most recent period included 618 million in restructuring 
expenses and debt restructuring costs 
for the full year the companys deficit of 1132 million 
compared to a loss of 83 million in 1986 came on a 37 percent 
decline in revenue to 102 billion from 106 billion 
the 1987 results included 96 million in restructuring expenses 
last month in the wake of a bitter strike at its production 
facility in manila mattel announced it would close that plant and 
pull out of the philippines 
mattel which does all of its manufacturing overseas shifted 
the philippines work to elsewhere in the orient that action was 
not a factor in the companys restructuring which dealt only with 
changes at the companys headquarters

the last hour of trading on the chicago board of trade grain 
futures closed mixed 
the soybean rally was sparked by one large speculative firm 
which began snapping up soybean futures and options contracts late

went said victor lespinasse a trader for the investment firm 
dean witter reynolds inc 
the august contract gained 10 cents a bushel 
mickey luth of shearson lehman brothers inc said the initial 
surge may have been linked to rising european demand for soybean 
meal 
corn prices retreated slightly on rumors the agriculture 
department plans to begin auctioning off surplus corn stocks in 
april the program would supposedly be similar to the usdas 
successful weekly wheat auctions begun in november which have 
increased the supply of wheat on the open market

its the ultimate valentines day challenge for 
lingerie retailers can you top this bottom 
from rhinestonestudded undies to briefs fitted with music boxes 
to a club that delivers perfumed giftwrapped panties the 
lingerie industry is shedding its cottondrawer image and 
exploiting the holiday of the heart 
some insiders say that for this special subcategory of womens 
clothing retailers valentines day is second only to christmas 
when it comes to racking up holiday sales their most compelling 
sales pitch is that no matter how scanty lingerie lasts longer 
than roses and isnt fattening like chocolates 
lila williams thinks her pantyofthemonth club covers the 
territory when it comes to imaginative love tokens this 
brooklynbased entrepreneur promises to put one pair of scented 
giftwrapped designer briefs in the mailbox for 1650 each month 
men are the main purchasers of her hidden couture she 
estimates 95 percent of the subscriptions to her panty club have 
been bought by men 
with more than 1000 customers williams makes sure the package 
and panty are colorcoded to the season last years april 
easter pair had a furry detachable bunny tail the july 
firework special was of course red white and blue and new 
years pair was silver silk 
williams said she handdyed 600 pieces of lingerie to a minty 
green for last st patricks day her thirdbiggest sales period 
this year however she found emerald satin panties trimmed with 
champagne lace and dont forget the optional erin go bra bra 
but fredericks of hollywoods 10 pair of musical panties is a 
tough contender 
cleverly hidden amid what little redandwhite lace makes up 
this undergarment which a company spokeswoman described as very 
small is a tiny computer box that can chirp out a rendition of 
let me call you sweetheart at the pull of a string 
though long considered outside the realm of highclass lingerie 
fredericks has managed to spawn 150 stores nationwide and post 
annual sales in the 58 million range spokeswoman ellen appel said 
for those who want to be a bit more extravagant bloomingdales 
in new york is selling rhinestonestudded red silk panties for 100 
a pair the matching camisole carries a 250 price tag 
the idea of sleaziness is leaving the american scene said 
carol palmer an analyst with duff amp phelps inc in chicago just 
look at how the square footage for lingerie in department stores is 
increasing 
indeed the last few years have seen a coming out of lingerie 
as a real fashion item said kurt barnard a retail marketing 
consultant and publisher of the newsletter retail marketing report 
over a year ago for example bloomingdales flagship manhattan 
store moved its lingerie department from the more pedestrian ground 
floor to upstairs next to designer clothing a spokeswoman said 
the industry is growing rather fast barnard said pointing 
to the limited inc as one major retailer that has focused on 
lingerie with its 237store victorias secret chain 
its likely well see more and more stores affiliated with 
lingerie spinoffs barnard predicted 
the actual size of the industry is difficult to gauge partly 
because many of the players are private companies and because the 
industry does not have a trade association 
but ray mcinerney publisher of intimate fashion news said his 
publication reported 1986 intimate apparel sales totaled 56 
billion 
while trailing sleepwear which posted 1986 sales of 142 
billion and bras which totaled 134 billion sales of panties 
reached 11 billion and ranked ahead of robes slips and girdles 
williams finds panties the most essential item she notes they 
come in the most colors and styles theyre the least expensive 
and most needed piece of intimate apparel 
this year has spurred a major growth in pants said lisa 
goldstein fashion editor for intimate apparel at womens wear 
daily she says theres a silhouette to fit any figure from 
bikinis to petits pants 
even the gstring and its minisculely more generous sister the 
thong panty continue to rack up sales i thought they would 
be a flash in the pan but christian dior and lily of france are 
doing a very big business in them she said

four months after the stock market collapse the 
government on friday reported a lower trade deficit rising prices 
and mounting piles of unsold goods baffling the markets over 
whether to expect inflation or recession 
the confusion was first reflected in the inflationsensitive 
bond market where prices first soared and then sank in a half hour 
of wild gyrations stocks and the dollar rose 
interest rates finished the day higher in a setback for 
individual and corporate borrowers that some economists believe 
could tip the precariously balanced economy into recession 
the commerce department said the merchandise trade deficit 
shrank to 122 billion in december the lowest figure since 
january 1987 even though the gap for all of 1987 totaled a record 
1712 billion 
exporting manufacturers are continuing to do a booming business 
but demand for imports remains healthy as well the trade report 
showed 
the impression of a strong potentially inflationary economy was 
heightened by the labor departments report that wholesale prices 
rose 04 percent in january 
the yield on the treasurys benchmark 30year bond an 
indicator for interest rates throughout the economy rose to 844 
percent from 835 percent late thursday as the bonds price sagged 
wall street took the reports more favorably than the bond market 
as the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 2172 points to 
198326 one hour before the close of new york stock exchange 
trading 
the dollar strengthened about 12 percent percent against key 
currencies rising to about 131 japanese yen and 171 west german 
marks 
contrasting with the signs of economic strength was one sign of 
weakness the commerce department said business inventories shot up 
08 percent in december the third consecutive large monthly 
advance 
the reports suggested that since the oct 19 stock plunge the 
economy remains balanced on the knife edge between inflation 
brought on by the improvement in trade and recession brought on 
by tight credit and sluggish consumer spending 
fridays jump in interest rates was interpreted by some 
economists as evidence that investors are confident about economic 
growth and concerned about the risks of inflation 
in addition to the reports on trade and wholesale prices the 
economy showed sparks of life in thursdays report that retail 
sales rose 05 percent in january 
we believe that there is enough strength in the manufcturing 
sector to prevent a recession and if we get any strength in the 
consumer side thats just gravy said douglas schindewolf 
associate economist for smith barney harris upham amp co 
but other economists said the economy shows fundamental signs of 
weakness such as the report that inventories of unsold goods are 
piling up on shelves 
investors are not especially worried about a resurgence of 
inflation argued robert brusca chief fixedincome economist for 
nikko securities co international inc 
disagreeing with the prevailing interpretation brusca argued 
that investors sold bonds friday because they had been expecting a 
cut in the discount rate by the federal reserve and didnt get it 
brusca said the federal reserve made a mistake by not cutting 
the discount rate which would have made life easier for borrowers 
and resuscitated an ailing economy 
when the patient has been pulled out of a pool thats a good 
time to administer artificial resuscitation rather than wait till 
he stops breathing brusca said 
the increase in producer prices reported friday was not large 
and followed three months of decline brusca said arguing against 
the likelihood of zooming inflation 
im concerned about what the fed has done here i dont think 
its good brusca said 
merrill lynch amp co economists believe fridays reports confirm 
their view that the economy will continue to slog forward through 
1988 and that a recession is not likely until 1989 said senior 
economist bruce steinberg 
steinberg said he does not believe a discount rate cut is either 
imminent or needed

millionaire industrialist victor posner avoided a 
prison term for federal income tax evasion but agreed friday to 
pay 3 million to help south floridas homeless pay more than 4 
million in back taxes and penalties and give 5000 hours in 
community service over five years 
the 69yearold miami beach businessman whose holdings include 
controlling interests in royal crown cola and arbys had little to 
say after the sentencing hearing but told reporters 
ive been involved in charity works all my life and ive 
given millions and millions to charity 
us district judge eugene p spellman cautioned posner in court 
not one dollar of the funds of this project are 
taxdeductible 
posner faced up to 40 years in prison after pleading no contest 
sept 29 to evading more than 12 million in federal taxes by 
inflating the value of land he donated to a bible college as a tax 
exemption 
a no contest plea is not an admission of guilt only a statement 
that the defendant will offer no defense for sentencing purposes 
it is equal to a guilty plea or conviction 
aside from paying the 4 million in back taxes penalties 
interest and fines posner was ordered to pay the cost of his own 
prosecution 
spellman said the homeless project will include dade broward 
and palm beach counties and he appointed a committee of civic 
leaders to determine how the money will be spent 
the judge warned that failure to abide by the terms of the 
agreement could result in jail time for posner 
the judge directed that as part of his community service 
posner spend five hours a day for one day each of the next eight 
weeks at camillus house a downtown miami mission for the homeless 
during the hearing posners attorney edward bennett williams 
of washington dc pleaded for an alternative to jail time 
williams said posner had always considered the tax case a civil 
matter but the internal revenue service did not see it that way 
and started a criminal investigation eight years ago 
because it is a unique case it provides the court with an 
opportunity under which mr posner could give of himself and his 
resources for the benefit of south florida williams said 
there are matters crying out for remedy williams told the 
court it would serve no useful purpose to incarcerate this 
defendant i appeal to your mercy and i appeal to your justice 
assistant us attorney neil cartusciello argued that a jail 
term was necessary as a deterrent to others 
mr posner lied to the internal revenue service and he 
corrupted others he said in his statement to the probation 
officers he makes the same claims and tells the same lies 
he doesnt show hes remorseful that hes sorry the honest 
taxpayers end up paying a disproportionate burden the prosecutor 
said 
posner entered the plea a month before he was to be retried his 
1986 conviction was set aside because of jury irregularities 
he pleaded in september to 10 charges conspiracy to evade 
income taxes four counts of tax evasion and five counts of making 
false statements in a tax return 
posner was indicted in 1982 accused of filing false returns 
between 1975 and 1979 and evading 12 million in taxes by 
inflating the value of property he donated to miami christian 
college 
miami real estate broker william h scharrer sr was charged 
with aiding and abetting in the tax violations he was convicted in 
1984 and sentenced to 18 months 
posners holdings also include controlling interests in sharon 
steel and the graniteville textile company he was named americas 
highestpaid executive by business week magazine in 1985 
the industrialist who rarely grants public interview 
reportedly earned 86 million in 1986 and his fortune was 
estimated at 240 million by forbes magazine in 1984 
he has sold off holdings in recent years to pay company debts 
his evans products co and sharon steel filed for reorganization 
under chapter 11 of us bankruptcy law

campeau said the firm cannot enter into such arrangements 
without our having a full and fair opportunity to compete with any 
offer you make including providing us with any information 
provided to you or any other third parties 
under ohios new law foreign businesses trying to acquire an 
ohio business are required to disclose financing plans and any

soybean futures prices leaped as much as 10 cents a bushel 
friday as speculators sparked a finalhour surge on the chicago 
board of trade 
on other markets grain futures were mixed precious metals 
firmed energy futures retreated and stockindex futures advanced 
the soybean rally was kicked off by one large speculative firm 
which began snapping up soybean futures and options contracts late 
in the session analysts said 
during the first two and half hours of the trading session it 
was basically a liquidation market with prices easier following a 
runup during the week said mickey luth an analyst in chicago 
with the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
then it started rallying and rallying and ran up to new highs 
on the day he said 
the runup triggered computercontrolled buy stops and up she 
went said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds 
inc 
the august contract gained 10 cents a bushel 
luth said the buying may have been linked to rising european 
demand for soybean meal 
corn prices retreated slightly on rumors the agriculture 
department plans to begin auctioning off surplus corn stocks in 
april lespinasse said the program would supposedly be similar to 
the usdas successful weekly wheat auctions begun in november 
which increase the supply of grain on the open market 
wheat futures advanced in line with soybeans after the close 
the usda announced substantial new export business including new 
sales of wheat to china algeria and finland 
wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in march at 332 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 1 cents 
lower with march at 201 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cent 
higher with march at 190 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 10 
cents higher with march at 627 a bushel 
gold and silver futures posted their best gains in more than a 
week on new yorks commodity exchange in apparent defiance of 
government trade figures released friday 
the commerce department reported the us trade deficit had 
narrowed to 122 billion in december compared with 132 billion 
in november the lowerthanexpected number helped strengthen the 
dollar which often leads to lower gold prices 
instead gold futures gained more than 5 a troy ounce perhaps 
in reaction to the labor departments announcement that wholesale 
prices rose a brisk 04 percent in january said craig sloane an 
analyst in new york for smith barney harris upham amp co 
sloane said thursdays government report of a 05 percent rise 
in retail sales in january also may have helped the metals markets 
which had been drifting lower on ideas the economy was slipping 
into a recession 
the increase in retail sales could suggest the economy is not 
going into recession and i think that is something the metal 
markets in general would view favorably sloane said the last 
thing they want to hear right now is anything having to do with 
recession 
gold settled 530 to 750 higher with the april at 44870 a 
troy ounce silver was 75 cents to 83 cents higher with march at 
639 a troy ounce 
energy futures slumped on the new york mercantile exchange in 
mostly technical trading analysts said 
merrill lynch analyst john hill said the charts continued to 
look weak and he predicted further declines on tuesday when 
trading resumes after the holiday weekend 
hill also said many traders were selling crudeoil contracts for 
march delivery and buying contracts for later delivery an 
indication they expect oil prices to fall in the near term 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 34 cents 
lower with march at 1677 a barrel heating oil was 61 cent to 
79 cent lower with march at 4660 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 37 cent to 76 cent lower with march at 4628 cents

norem an analyst for agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill 
live cattle settled 18 cent lower to 10 cent higher with 
february at 7165 cents a pound feeder cattle were 60 cent lower

belgian financier andre leysen friday 
failed to push through a francobelgian deal to control societe 
generale de belgique sa giving rival italian investor carlo de 
benedettis bid a major boost 
leysen could not get enough backing from a group of mostly 
belgian investors to ratify an accord with the french holding cie 
financiere de suez to restructure belgiums biggest holding concern 
and keep it anchored in belgium 
leysen said he considered his mandate as spokesman for the group 
as over 
because of the failure the battle for control for societe 
generale one of the pillars of the belgian economy remains open 
suez however said it is continuing discussions with all the 
belgian shareholders wanting to cooperate in gaining control of 
the company that has a stake in a third of the belgian economy 
it said leysens decision to relinquish his leading role 
absolutely does not call into question the goal sought by the 
belgian and french partners to restructure the 166yearold 
company 
societe generale has interests in about 1400 companies 
worldwide with assets totaling nearly 3 billion 
de benedetti did not comment on fridays developments he wants 
effective control of societe generale in order to use it as a 
platform for a paneuropean financial holding 
he also has offered to continue negotiations with the belgian 
shareholders but has excluded suez from such negotiations 
the italian investor claims to be the biggest shareholder and 
says he can control through allies 38 percent of stock in the 
company he is launching a public offer monday for 15 percent more 
in the public offer de benedetti is willing to offer 4000 
francs 11430 per share 150 francs 430 less than fridays 
closing price on the brussels stock exchange 
the price had plunged 14 percent friday from 4850 francs 
13860 and brokers blamed it on leysens failure which caused 
many market participants to conclude de benedetti had won the 
battle for control 
the group of mostly belgian investors formed around leysen said 
it had 28 percent of stocks in the company while suez claimed 15 
percent together with allies leysen said they had a majority of 
shares 
but important groups within the coalition did not support the 
accord cobepa linked to leysen and paribas a french rival of 
suez has an estimated 4 percent of the shares of societe generale 
and said the plan lacked a clear industrial program 
the belgian group uniting beer brewers artois and piedboeuf also 
failed to agree to the terms 
the accord was favored by the current management of societe 
generale which has come under sharp attack by de benedetti 
fridays developments followed a week of frantic negotiations 
between the three interested parties and threatened to defeat de 
benedettis bid to create a paneuropean holding centered around 
the belgian company

bond prices sagged friday as hopes faded for 
continued declines in interest rates and concerns grew about 
inflation 
the activity occurred against a backdrop of new government 
reports that included a smallerthanexpected december trade 
deficit and a rise in wholesale prices in january 
by late afternoon the treasurys 30year bond was off point 
or 875 for every 1000 in face value it rose more than 10 
shortly after the trade report was released before quickly 
reversing course 
its yield climbed to 843 percent from 835 percent late 
thursday 
the government reported the us trade imbalance fell to 122 
billion in december from 132 billion in november 
the report sent bond prices higher because the deficit was lower 
than many analysts had expected and indicated the gap could shrink 
without new declines in the dollar a falling dollar discourages 
foreign investors such as the japanese from buying us securities 
but the rise was shortlived as bond prices abruptly changed 
direction 
analysts said the reversal occurred because the markets 
attention shifted from the trade report to a second government 
report that wholesale prices rose 04 percent in january after a 
04 percent decline in december 
paul boltz chief financial economist for t rowe price 
associates a baltimorebased investment company said the 
wholesale price numbers triggered some concerns about inflation 
which would erode the value of bonds 
at midday the federal reserve took steps for the second day in 
a row to arrange securities sales that had the effect of draining 
reserves from the banking system 
some analysts said that signaled the central bank had no 
intention of further relaxing its credit policy and that it raised 
questions about whether it had eased its policy earlier this week 
as some economists believed it had 
the federal funds rate the closelywatched interest charge on 
shortterm loans between banks edged up to 6 1116 percent from 6 
percent late thursday 
the rate is often seen as an indication of which way the fed 
wants shortterm rates to go and when it fell below 6 percent 
earlier this week some economists concluded that the fed had 
relaxed its credit policy 
the market had gotten overexuberant on the possibility of 
further fed easing but after the fed drained reserves the 
funds rate kicked up the prospect of fed easing is up in the 
air said elliott platt research director for the investment 
firm donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities inc 
late friday afternoon the fed disclosed its policymakers 
decided in december to end aggressive efforts to push interest 
rates lower believing that the immediate threat from the october 
stock market collapse had passed 
fed policymakers met again tuesday and wednesday but did not 
disclose any results of their actions 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds on friday prices of 
shortterm governments fell point intermediate maturities 
dropped point and 20year issues fell 1 points according to 
figures provided by the financial information service telerate inc 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer fell 052 to 11332 the shearson lehman daily 
treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement lost 547 
to 118517 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer fell 131 to 28265 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose 12 basis points to 
575 percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
sixmonth bills rose 10 basis points to 601 percent and oneyear 
bills gained 8 basis points to 625 percent

the us trade deficit narrowed to 122 
billion in december as exports hit new records but the overall 
1712 billion shortfall for 1987 still measured the highest ever 
the government said friday 
decembers merchandise trade deficit was down from 132 billion 
in november and from 176 billion in october and was the smallest 
figure since a 119 billion trade gap in january 1987 the 
commerce department said 
the improvement was driven by a 42 percent rise in exports 
which reached record levels for the second month in a row 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
2172 to 198326 a subdued response to the trade report bond 
prices fell as concern grew about inflation but the dollar soared 
against most major currencies 
both private and government analysts pointed toward the december 
report as strong evidence of the longawaited reversal in the 
nations trade peformance 
the tide has turned declared allen sinai chief economist 
for the boston company economic advisers inc 
exports in december were 248 billion a new record up from 
238 billion in november the previous record imports meanwhile 
held steady at 370 billion the same as the month before 
were beginning to see our economy driven by exports and that 
means economic vitality and increased jobs for americans 
commerce secretary c william verity said in a statement 
but he said the overall deficit for the year up 96 percent 
from 1562 billion in 1986 was unacceptable we have a long 
way to go until we can be comfortable 
for all of 1987 americans imported 4241 billion in goods from 
other countries while exporting 2529 billion compared with 1986 
imports of 3830 billion and exports of 2268 billion 
analysts credited the slide in the dollar now worth half of 
its 1985 value against the japanese yen and key european currencies 
as being the major factor in the recent export surge 
a devalued dollar makes american goods cheaper abroad 
and while it will also eventually drive up the price of 
imports this effect has not yet been fully realized as many 
foreign manfacturers take smaller profit margins to hang onto their 
share of lucrative us markets analysts said 
still other economists suggested that the december figures be 
looked at cautiously claiming that the monthly trade figures 
although closely watched by financial markets tend to be erratic 
for one thing the figures are not adjusted to remove the impct 
of seasonal factors such as increases in imports before christmas 
and when newmodel auto shipments come in early each summer 
on a seasonal basis the trade gap traditionally improves in 
december and january economists said 
to meet this concern the commerce department announced on 
friday that beginning with the release of april trade figures it 
would seasonally adjust the monthly data 
in other economic data on friday 
the labor department said its producer price index rose 04 
percent in january equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of 
46 percent with higher costs for a variety of items including 
food offsetting lower energy prices 
the commerce department said business inventories shot up 08 
percent in december the third consecutive large monthly advance 
pushing unsold stockpiles on shelves and backlots up by 545 
billion to a seasonally adjusted 70187 billion 
of the december trade figures us trade representative clayton 
yeutter said this is a sign that there are better days ahead on 
the trade front 
and jay goldinger senior economist for cantor fitzgerald a 
bond brokerage predicted that imports would soon begin to fall as 
sharply as exports have risen as we work off the high level of 
import inventories 
were in the middle of a major change of course but its a 
big ship and you dont turn around a big ship on a dime 
goldinger said at least we know were headed home again 
the united states continued to run its largest deficit with 
japan last year 598 billion up from 586 billion in 1986 
however imports from japan in december held at their november 
level of 48 billion 
eclipsing western europe for the first time as the 
secondlargest trade deficit were the socalled four tigers of 
asia the newly industrialized nations of taiwan south korea hong 
kong and singapore together the trade deficit with those nations 
in 1987 rose to 377 billion up from 308 billion in 1986 
the deficit with western europe meanwhile narrowed to 302 
billion from 327 billion in the previous year 
trade accounts with canada this nations largest single 
trading partner also improved during 1987 to a deficit of 117 
billion from 132 billion in 1986 
for the full year imports of manufactured goods rose 107 
percent to 3252 billion while exports of us manufactured goods 
rose 153 percent to 1715 billion 
oil imports were up 191 percent to 448 billion as oil 
prices rebounded from their 1986 collapse 
and in the only major category in which the united states has 
consistently maintained a surplus farm product exports were up 96 
percent to 286 billion 
automobile imports from japan totaled 222 billion for the 
year a 09 percent increase but those from canada were down 135 
percent to 102 billion 
from all other countries auto imports were up a sharp 322 
percent to 168 billion reflecting popularity of model lines 
like the south korean hyundai automobile

gillettes nonemployee directors to fully evaluate all takeover 
proposals and stock repurchase agreements for the next three years

takeover bids and make certain public statements about the offers

fees as part of the settlement

1986 agreement prohibiting any attempts to takeover gillette for 10 
years two other suits were filed in 1987 as amendments to the 
original suits

new york investor donald trump may 
seek up to 249 percent of mca inc the parent of universal 
studios the entertainment conglomerate said friday 
it has been speculated for more than a year that mca would be a 
takeover target but until now no suitor has emerged 
some analysts have long contended the companys stock was 
undervalued but it was believed a hostile takeover would be 
difficult because mca is ruled with an iron hand by lew wasserman 
the last of the oldline movie moguls 
wasserman 74 has been with mca and its forerunner music corp 
of america since 1936 
in a brief announcement mca said it had been notified by trump 
that he owns 375000 of the companys shares and may seek to 
acquire 249 percent 
mca has 771 million shares outstanding 
mcas announcement came after the stock market closed but the 
companys stock already had jumped by 525 per share to 45 on 
rumors that a takeover bid was in the offing 
like most other companies mcas shares took a beating in the 
stock market crash and never fully recovered in the past year 
their highest price was 6450 
trump spokeswoman norma foerderer in new york said she had no 
comment 
mca takeover speculation peaked in mid1987 when wasserman was 
hospitalized for a prolonged period after what was to have been 
routine surgery to remove a polyp from his colon 
however wasserman did return to the helm of the entertainment 
giant after five weeks reportedly with his corporate power 
undiminished 
to dissaude suitors mca last july adopted a poisonpill 
permitting stockholders to buy new shares at half price if a 
hostile bidder acquired more than 20 percent of mca or made an 
unsolicited tender offer for more than 30 percent 
wassermans control comes more from the respect he commands than 
from the stock he controls 
wasserman owns 69 percent of mcas stock and controls another 
89 percent through a series of trusts including those of the 
family of mca founder jules stein 
from its beginning as a hollywood talentbooking agency mca has 
grown into a powerhouse in producing movies television 
programming records and toys 
it operates a successful backlot tour of universal studios here 
is building one in florida and has agreed to build one in japan in 
all three locations it would be competing with theme parks by its 
archrival walt disney co 
mca also is involved in book publishing retail and mailorder 
businesses 
in 1987 mca earned 1379 million or 197 per share a 
decrease of 9 percent from a year earlier when it netted 1509 
million or 197 per share 
the decline would have been even more dramatic except that the 
1986 results already were depressed by a 50 million writeoff to 
cover bills it was unlikely to collect from independent television 
stations that had used mca programs 
trump who made his fortune in new york real estate is building 
a casino empire with two hotelgaming houses already in atlantic 
city nj and a permit pending for a third one 
trump also is seeking to gain total control of atlantic 
citybased resorts international inc he already owns 90 percent of 
the companys voting power 
in addition trump in the past has acquired stakes in takeover 
targets and later sold them for a handsome profit
