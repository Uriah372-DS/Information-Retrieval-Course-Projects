president joaquin 
balaguer said thursday he will call out the army if necessary to 
quell disturbances that cost three lives in two days 
balaguer also asked for his entire cabinets resignation saying 
it had to be restructured to respond to the present 
circumstances 
in the central and northeastern provinces police battled 
demonstrators who blocked the main avenues in the cities and threw 
rocks at police and commercial establishments 
late thursday authorities said a 72hour strike had ended in 
eastcentral sanchez ramirez province where protests started 11 
years ago peasants there demonstrated against alleged cyanide and 
sulfur contamination of rivers from a stateowned gold mine 
earlier company officials denied any contamination existed but 
said that up to 130 families would be moved to a farm inside the 
province away from the mine 
the protests which grew to include other issues have been the 
worst since balaguer took office 1 years ago in this caribbean 
island nation of more than 65 million people 
in azua 75 miles west of the capital city of santo domingo 
protesters detonated homemade bombs and burned tires in some areas 
but police said most of the town was under control 
a 15yearold newspaper vendor shot in azua on wednesday was 
reported to have died two other people were killed wednesday 
more than a dozen people have been reported wounded by gunfire 
and an undetermined number have been arrested in the eight 
provinces affected by the unrest 
much of the countrys commercial activity has been paralyzed and 
schools remained closed 
the protests spread to other parts of the country where 
residents demanded capital improvements and government action to 
control inflation estimated at about 30 percent annually 
balaguer went on television to deliver his message from the 
national palace shortly after midnight wednesday he said the 
government would tolerate public protests as long as they were 
peaceful but would not accept acts of vandalism and violence 
if the circumstances demand it we will confront these 
demonstrations and use all the military and physical power the 
state has to stop them he said 
he added however that his government would not repeat the 
events in 1984 when soldiers shot and killed almost 100 people 
demonstrating against price increases 
we wont have a slaughter like the one april 23 24 and 25 
1984 he said 
there was no word on whether the cabinet had submitted its 
resignation and no replacements were announced

mayor art agnos on friday said the city 
faces a whopping 172 million budget deficit next year that will 
require layoffs painful cuts in service and possibly tax 
increases and fare hikes 
this is the worst budget crisis in the modern history of san 
francisco declared agnos who was inaugurated in january 
to close this kind of gap we have to consider big cuts 
things like closing hospital wards clinics and mental health 
programs freezing city employee pay shutting branch libraries and 
cutting back bus runs he said 
agnos flanked by his fiscal advisers said at a news conference 
that the latest revised budget analysis indicates the city faces a 
1724 million deficit nearly 100 million more than was forecast 
in november 
at the same time we were contemplating these kinds of painful 
service cuts we could be asking citizens to put up with higher 
muni fares parking rate hikes added business levies and increased 
fees for city services agnos said 
the mayor said the 1724 million deficit is the equivalent of 
more than 5000 city jobs he offered no specific targets in regard 
to layoffs 
the more than doubling of the deficit was blamed largely on an 
estimated drop in revenue of 28 million 40 million in judgments 
against the city from employee litigation and rising costs of 
employee health benefits and other programs 
there is no easy way out of this problem the mayor said 
everyone in this city is going to have to bear some pain to get 
our fiscal house back in order 
agnos stopped short of blaming his predecessor dianne 
feinstein for the financial crisis but said the citys surplus of 
150 million in 198283 has dropped to ground zero

the vatican revealed its financial statement 
for the first time in history thursday disclosing that the 
administrative headquarters for the worlds 840 million roman 
catholics ran an operating deficit of 567 million in 1986 the 
washington post reported in fridays editions 
the statement was made public by the washingtonbased national 
conference of catholic bishops ending centuries of secrecy 
cardinal john krol said a 15man council of cardinals on which 
he sits decided last october to release the information in the hope 
such openness would stimulate the faithful to contribute more to 
the church 
the deficit was met by taking 32 million from peters pence 
the vaticans annual worldwide collection intended for charitable 
purposes and 247 million more from the funds reserve the post 
said 
the peters pence collection for the first nine months of 1987 
totaled 358 million an increase attributed at least in part to 
repeated pleas for help the newspaper said 
the document revealed that vatican expenses in 1986 totaled 
nearly 114 million with the largest chunk 58 million spent for 
personnel that included 506 million for the vaticans 2395 
employees and 73 million for pension payments to 885 retirees 
other major expenses included 117 million for publishing 11 
million in expenditures related to investments 104 million for 
equipment and operating costs of vatican radio and 97 million for 
administrative expenses ranging from stationery to the costs of 
worldwide synods of bishops 
operating income comes from investments publishing endowments 
and vatican radios sale of tapes of papal speeches and radio 
programs 
we need complete accounting krol told us bishops at their 
annual meeting here last fall its the only way to go 
krol retird last month as head of the philadelphia archdiocese 
but continues to head special fundraising efforts for the church

ardito barletta resigned under pressure from the military after 11 
months as the countrys first democratically elected president in

although delvalle is president there has been little question 
that gen manuel antonio noriega the armed forces chief runs the 
country 
noriega inherited command of the military from gen omar 
torrijos who seized power in 1968 and died in a plane crash in 
1981 
the reagan administration called for noriega to resign after 
us grand juries indicted him and others on drug trafficking 
charges on feb 5 however there had been us pressure for him to 
leave for some time 
in june noriegas former secondincommand sparked the 
countrys most serious unrest in years when he publicly accused 
noriega of election fraud drug trafficking and the assassination

in a pasture thursday killing nine soldiers and seriously burning 
nine authorities said 
two soldiers fell 35 feet after leaping from the burning 
twinrotor ch47d chinook as it hurtled toward the ground about 50 
miles from fort worth said state department of public safety sgt 
robert rankin one of the soldiers died 
the other soldier said that a fire had broken out at the back of 
the helicopter based at fort sill okla and that those aboard had 
tried to move to the front to get away from the flames according 
to rankin 
we do have some witnesses who said they saw parts falling off 
back toward chico several miles away and some of the witnesses 
said it was on fire before impact he said 
nine soldiers were killed and nine injured said fort hood 
spokesman lt col michael miller eighteen people were aboard 
said rick brink a fort sill spokesman the injured were listed in 
serious and critical condition 
many of the soldiers suffered thirddegree burns some over 
their entire bodies others were wrapped in body bags after 
firefighters extinguished the grass fire authorities said

sparked a grass fire said lt brad schuldt of carswell air force 
base another soldier died at parkland memorial hospital said 
administrator paula sears 
a ninth soldier died at bridgeport hospital said justice of the 
peace dawayne kennedy 
the cause of the crash was not immediately known a team of 
investigators from fort rucker ala was en route thursday night 
said col herbert blanks 
in 1985 the army grounded its entire fleet of 63 of the giant 
ch47d helicopters after an accident in honduras injured eight 
soldiers the order was lifted after a month and a half 
wendell berry a farmer said he saw the copter skid about 75 
yards before breaking apart in flames thursday he said he tried to 
fight the flames with a fire extinguisher and helped douse burning 
bodies scattered about the wreckage 
we put a lot of fire on people out berry said we 
couldnt do very much but get em out of the way we actually could 
do very little nobody could really do anything 
one was up walking around the rest were out on ground i cut 
the pilot or the assistant pilot i cut his seatbelt loose he 
added he was wanting me to cut him out of there and i did that 
he was conscious talking to me

more than 33 combatequipped soldiers 
winford mcdaniel supervisor of a rockcrushing business two

about three feet long and three feet across 
i was driving west of chico and saw smoke coming out of the 
helicopter and knew it was going to crash said james st john 
i drove out there and it had already crashed i seen it when it 
was going down but not when it crashed 
the ch47d is a modernized version of the earlier models of the 
chinook which for years has been a part of the army inventory 
in the honduras accident a transmission bearing failed on a 
ch47d taxiing to a refueling depot the failure caused one of the 
copters main rotors to stop turning the other rotor began hitting 
it and the helicopter tore itself apart 
the chinookss main rotors mesh as they turn and therefore must 
be synchronized 
eight soldiers were killed in april 1986 when a ch47 and

israeli analysts say riots in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip began spontaneously 11 weeks ago but the plo 
and islamic groups are playing an increasing role in the unrest 
president reagan said at a news conference wednesday that 
terrorists and outsiders were behind much of the violence 
yasser arafat chief of the palestine liberation organization 
said in an interview with swedish television earlier this month 
that he planned and controlled the palestinian uprising 
all indications point to a spontaneous beginning of riots dec 
8 when an army truck killed four palestinians outside the jabaliya 
refugee camp in the gaza strip 
the accident occurred the day after an israeli was fatally 
stabbed in gaza city and rumors swept the camp that the truck hit 
the arabs on purpose 
israels un ambassador benyamin netanyahu told reporters the 
rumor was helped along by a plo broadcast on baghdad radio 
jabaliya residents held an overnight march and the first 
casualties were recorded dec 9 two arabs killed and 18 wounded by 
israeli soldiers 
journalists on the scene discover that many clashes are started 
by such local incidents as army arrest raids or the funerals of 
arabs shot during protests 
ohers begin after announcements from the loudspeakers of 
mosques usually untrue that say jewish settlers are headed for 
villages or towns on vigilante rampages 
brig gen arieh shalev military governor of the west bank in 
197476 said control of the protests was split among several 
groups arafats mainstream plo syrianbacked palestinian groups 
and local islamic fundamentalist organizations 
they use leaflets radio broadcasts from iraq and syria and 
orders relayed by telephone to activists in the west bank and gaza 
he said in an interview 
shalev said the plo had strong influence as a symbol but its 
organizational structure was weak in the territories partly 
because of an army crackdown that has jailed nearly 2000 activists 
since december 
as a result he said local groups would follow plo directives 
only if they were deemed reasonable 
if they ordered people to stop working at jobs in israel 
altogether people would not pay attention because they have no 
alternative the general said 
reporters sometimes have seen highly organized local responses 
by palestinians 
at gaza citys shifa hospital in december community leaders met 
in the directors office to plan strategy while youths piled up 
stones in the courtyard demonstrators handed reporters printed 
lists of grievances 
in jerusalem journalists saw arab medical teams arrive from 
neighboring areas as youths set up makeshift barricades and 
prepared to attack soldiers with stones 
amnon linn chairman of a parliamentary subcommittee on the west 
bank and gaza strip said 80 percent of the riots now result from 
plo leaflets 
they call on people to revolt and kill anyone who makes an 
attempt to negotiate with israel or has any relations with israeli 
authorities said linn former head of the labor partys arab 
department 
nahum barnea editor of the leftist magazine koteret rashit 
said the plo was suprised by the start of the riots it was not 
initiated by the plo 
barnea said in an interview the plo stepped in later with 
directives for commercial strikes and boycotts 
he said plo influence sometimes helped restrain young arabs from 
escalating the violence with knives guns and bombs so in a way 
it is a positive sign the plo has never before had the power to 
control events 
col yoni an israeli commander in the west bank whose full name 
could not be used in keeping with army regulations told a reporter 
last week most of the disturbances are now deliberate attacks on 
soldiers 
the army has reported attacks in the past week that indicate 
palestinians may be moving up from stones to knives and other 
deadly weaspons 
a military vehicle was ambushed tuesday night in the gaza strip 
by arabs who exploded a roadside bomb and opened fire with guns no 
one was hurt

gen manuel antonio noriega is a 
shrewd tough politician who has shown he can hold on tightly to 
his position as the de facto ruler of panama 
supporters call noriega in english the man a takeoff on 
his initials critics call him in spanish cara de pina or 
pineapple face because of his pocked and jowly visage 
the united states calls him a fugitive from justice a man who 
put himself and his country up for sale to drug traffickers and 
made millions of dollars in the process 
indictments returned by federal grand juries in miami and tampa 
fla on feb 5 accuse noriega of using his position as the 
commander of the defense forces to permit colombian drug 
traffickers to make panama a base for smuggling cocaine and 
marijuana into the united states 
noriega was born into poverty and raised by foster parents from 
the age of 5 
details of noriegas early life are scarce and even his birthday 
is in dispute his official biography lists his age as 50 but high 
school records put it at 54 
after attending a military college in peru on a scholarship 
noriega entered the panamanian national guard in 1962 as a 
lieutenant he quickly became acquainted with a rising young 
officer named omar torrijos 
torrijos took power in panama in a 1968 coup and less than a 
year later named noriega then an obscure major in charge of the 
countrys northernmost province as his chief of intelligence with 
the rank of lieutenant colonel 
in his new position noriega began collecting dossiers on 
everyone who counted in panama friends and enemies alike he also 
had jurisdiction over the countrys customs and immigration 
departments long a source of funds for the military 
when torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981 
noriega was well placed to shoulder his way to the top command 
ahead of several more senior officers it took him two years 
panama has been rocked by protests since last june when 
noriegas recently retired second in command publicly charged the 
general with drug trafficking electoral fraud and the 
assassination of a political opponent 
noriega also has been accused of having his finger in a wide 
variety of other enterprises some legal and others operating on 
the fringes of the law they are said to include duty free liquor 
stores maritime services banks gambling casinos newspapers a 
television station and 12 radio stations

the first people to reach the cow pasture 
where an army helicopter crashed thursday described the scene as a 
war zone that smelled of burning oil and flesh 
nine soldiers died and nine were injured when the ch47d chinook 
went down northeast of chico officials said 
two men who raced to the helicopter when they saw it puff smoke 
and descend onto a neighbors field said they pulled one pilot from 
the wreckage and doused flames on the soldiers 
jack souther a 54yearold pipeline worker said he used a 
small fire extinguisher he carries in his pickup truck to put out 
the flames on at least six soldiers 
i couldnt fight any fire with it souther said the only 
thing i could do was put the fires out on the bodies i went from 
body to body trying to put them out 
souther said two teenagers arrived at the crash just before he 
and his soninlaw john karch did 
one of the teenagers dale christopher 17 said he told one of 
the victims that he was lucky he said what do you mean and i 
said man theres people scattered everywhere christopher said 
christopher said the smell of the burning metal oil and flesh 
was overwhelming it was the smell of death he said 
wendell berry 53 who lives a halfmile from the crash and 
arrived just after souther and karch said he cut the seat belt 
from a pilot who was trapped in the cockpit he was conscious and 
talking to me berry said 
volunteer firefighters who were dousing a grass fire west of 
chico responded to the crash said firefighter blane rice 
souther said the victims were scattered in all directions from 
the helicopter but that most were caught in a fire in front of the 
wreckage 
it was a war zone bodies were scattered everywhere there was 
just a couple of bodies out of the fire area souther said 
he said that after they doused the fires on the victims they 
made them lie where they were until firefighters and medical 
personnel arrived 
i know it was probably hot laying there but i think it was 
better that they stayed still souther said 
berry said he saw the crash but his view was partially blocked 
by trees he slid about 75 yards before he blew up he said 
between my eyesight and the copter was a tree 
souther said he and karch could tell by the way the craft was 
flying that it would crash you could see it puffing smoke i 
told my soninlaw lets go that thing is going down souther

there is an old cowboy saying that daylightsaving 
time is like making a blanket longer by cutting off one end and 
sewing it on the other 
some colorado lawmakers however are trying for the second time 
in two years to shift the state to yearround daylightsaving time 
to ease metropolitan denvers air pollution problem said to be the 
nations worst 
sen bill schroeder the republican sponsor of the measure 
wants to keep the state on daylightsaving time from the end of 
october to the first part of april when it normally reverts to 
mountain standard time 
schroeder said the measure which cleared the state senate by an 
1815 vote on monday and now goes to the house of representatives 
would give colorado an extra hour of daylight in the winter that 
would mean another hour for polluting auto emissions which often 
are trapped at ground level by a warmer layer of air to escape 
into the upper atmosphere he said 
don barbarick a meteorologist with the colorado health 
department sees yearround daylightsaving time in colorado as a 
way to put denver air pollution in step with mother nature 
denver is on an arid high plain a few miles east of the 
rockies and is noted for its dry climate and cool nights a 
perfect setting for shifting afternoon rushhouse traffic back an 
hour barbarick said 
schroeder said studies have shown that if there were 
daylightsaving time there would be a 7 percent reduction in 
violations of federal air pollution standards in metropolitan 
denver 
if the proposal passes the legislature is signed into law by 
gov roy romer and authorized by congress colorado would become 
the first state to adopt such a time variance 
arizona stays on standard time yearround and counties in 
indiana can elect to remain on eastern standard time continually 
but no other state has embraced daylightsaving time on a 
yearround basis because no state has made such a time change 
congress would have to pass a resolution authorizing it 
the proposal pits urbanites who must deal with denvers air 
pollution problem against rural and smalltown coloradans 
opponents say schoolchildren would have to rise long before 
daylight to get to school on time 
we shouldnt have little kids standing around in the dark 
waiting for buses said sen al meiklejohn who champions 
educational issues there are going to be some major disruptions 
this is not a good idea 
schroeder however says school districts may reschedule 
classroom hours around actual daylight hours if they wish 
last year one resolution supporting a time shift died in the 
colorado house and another cleared the house but died in the senate 
opponents say too much is made of denvers problems and they 
point to this years twomonth switch to oxygenated fuels as an 
example of urban problems spilling into rural areas 
oxygenrich additives make gasoline burn cleaner with less 
carbon monoxide emissions but fuel refiners and distributors said 
it would have been too complicated to supply the special fuel just 
to metropolitan areas 
since the fuel switch there have been loud complaints from 
rural senators republican sen ray powers said some of his 
constituents have complained that oxygenated fuels make their 
chainsaws sputter 
barbarick said the time change is no cureall for air pollution 
some days it wont work for you at all he said but its 
getting in step with mother nature its an an attempt to get in 
step with something that happens nearly every day during the 
winter

the white house is scrambling to untangle some 
of president reagans news conference answers offering details 
emphasis and elaboration but no retractions 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was hit with a barrage of 
questions at his regular press briefing thursday about what the 
president meant on several subjects during his nationally televised 
news conference the night before 
fitzwater avoided saying that reagan had misspoken on any 
subject but he played down reagans comment that outsiders were 
stirring up trouble in israelioccupied territories and he also 
said an apparent contradiction with secretary of state george 
shultz on iran arms sales was a matter of interpretation 
reagan had been asked at the news conference about violence in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and the beatings and 
shootings of palestinians by israeli forces 
he replied that there is every evidence to believe that these 
riots are not just spontaneous and homegrown we have had 
intimations that there have been certain people suspected of being 
terrorists outsiders coming in not only with weapons but 
stirring up and encouraging the trouble in those areas 
shultz en route to the middle east gave a decidedly different 
slant blaming the unrest on longtime israeli occupation of the 
territories 
its fundamental origins are essentially indigenous he told 
reporters aboard his plane 
shultz said intelligence material showed a mixed picture 
with interaction with outside force but he added there is 
an underlying problem consisting of a large number of people in 
occupation who havent had the basic rights of governance 
in his news conference answer reagan did not mention the 
israeli occupation saying merely that the united states wants a 
solution representing justice for all 
fitzwater said the comments of reagan and shultz are totally 
consistent as far as were concerned 
he added the president said the same thing as shultz 
that they were partly influenced by outside sources 
reagan however did not use the word partly 
when it was noted that the president had made no mention of 
indigenous origins of the problem the spokesman replied no 
he didnt use those words but thats clear 
fitzwater said he could not elaborate on the identity of any 
outside forces or quantify the extent of their involvement 
reagan also raised questions wednesday night by saying shultz 
and former defense secretary caspar w weinberger had not objected 
to the secret sale of arms to iran on the grounds that it was an 
armsforhostages deal 
shultz and weinberger have said otherwise and their statements 
have been supported by the irancontra report issued by congress 
shultz said wednesday night he had testified endlessly on 
the subject and i am not going to go over it any more 
fitzwater said he did not feel that reagans statement needed 
any reconciliation with the record on shultzs comments these 
are all matters of interpretation he said im not going to go 
into that i dont have anything to add 
asked whether reagan regretted having said the kidnappers of 
marine lt col william higgins in lebanon would have a hard time 
getting secrets from him fitzwater declined to comment i 
dont want to say anything that might inflame the situation he 
said 
fitzwater said he could not elaborate on reagans remark that 
there is a great division even among the black people who are 
being oppressed in whiteruled south africa 
it is a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy and 
that is one of the most difficult parts here reagan said 
wednesday night 
asked to explain fitzwater said i dont remember that 
specific reference i dont have any elaboration on that 
on another matter reagan had told reporters that the question 
of soviet participation in an international trade organization was 
being reviewed not mentioning that his administration 
staunchly opposes its participation 
fitzwater said the president was saying the matter was under 
review in the sense that we review it every year as part of that 
annual national security report but the conclusion of that 
review is that their economy is not compatible with membership in 
the group known as the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
asked if he agreed that reagan had failed to make the point 
about the united states opposing soviet participation fitzwater 
drew laughter by saying i would say the president expressed it 
with great clarity

the reagan administration has made no secret 
deals on afghanistan and will arm guerrillas there until that 
support is no longer needed to gain permanent withdrawal of 
soviet troops a senior official told congress 
we will not abandon the afghan resistance robert peck 
deputy assistant seceretary of state said thursday in testimony 
before the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asian and pacific 
affairs 
peck also welcomed a statement by resistance leaders that they 
would agree to an interim government consisting of some afghans 
currently in kabul possibly noncommunist members of the kremlins 
client government 
peck denied charges by some resistance leaders and conservative 
members of congress that the administration has agreed to a deal 
that would cut off aid at the beginning of a soviet withdrawal 
possibly allowing the red army or the afghan regime to slaughter 
the insurgents 
a proposed un agreement to end the afghan war contains 
provisions the administration understands would bar the kremlin 
from arming its clients in kabul or waging offensive operations 
against the guerrillas peck said 
continued military aid or offensive operations by the soviets in 
afghanistan would violate provisions of the unsponsored accord 
guaranteeing noninterference and nonintervention he said 
soviet officials have said they expect us aid to end 60 days 
after an agreement is signed but have not said when they would 
stop aiding kabul 
it is a matter on which we are not completely satisfied and 
we intend to pressure them peck said 
but the administration would oppose any congressional resolution 
calling for the president to continue military aid to the 
guerrillas until the departure of the last of the estimated 120000 
soviet soldiers from afghanistan peck said rep david dreier 
rcalif and sen steve symms ridaho are preparing such 
resolutions congressional aides said 
the president wishes not to have his hands tied peck said 
we will continue our assistance to the afghan resistance until 
that support is no longer needed but the question of when to cut 
off aid is one that should be left to the president 
peck denied that administration officials agreed in december 
1985 without president reagans knowledge to abide by the un 
agreement before final details were worked out 
there have been no secret deals peck said no deals at 
all 
the united nationssponsored talks in which pakistan is 
representing the guerrillas and the kabul regime is representing 
the soviets are to resume next wednesday kremlin leader mikhail 
s gorbachev has said that if the talks produce an accord soviet 
troops will start leaving by may 15 and be gone within 10 months 
pakistani officials who originally demanded soviet withdrawal 
over three months now say eight months is acceptable but they 
want the parties to agree on the formation of an interim government 
soviet negotiators have accused pakistan of introducing new 
demands at the last minute a charge echoed by rep stephen j 
solarz subcommittee chairman 
it may not be possible to fashion such a government in which 
case it would be a tragedy if as a consequence of such a 
condition we ended up without an interim government but with the 
continued presence of soviet forces in afghanistan said solarz 
dny 
it does seem somewhat incongruous that after having pushed the 
soviets for eight years to get out of afghanistan pakistan at the 
11th hour introduced new conditions that may make such a withdrawal 
more difficult solarz said 
the pakistani demand is neither unreasonable nor likely to 
prevent a soviet withdrawal and may be discussed if not resolved 
in negotiations seperate from the un talks in geneva peck said 
resolution seemed closer he said following a statement this 
week by resistance leaders in peshawar pakistan that they would 
take part in a 28member cabinet seven of whose ministers could be 
moslems now in kabul the formula he said appears to open to door 
to moderates within the communistdominated government 
we are delighted that they have now produced a detailed 
alliance proposal peck said we await a response from the 
other side

bob dole wants to believe that the key 
southern test in the republican presidential race will occur not on 
super tuesday but next august in new orleans 
thats a strategy heavily dependent on a strong assist from pat 
robertson who has the potential to muddy the outcome on march 8 
when 20 states most of them southern and border states will hold 
republican primaries or caucuses 
ive got a feeling we may be headed all the way to new 
orleans the kansas senator says at every campaign stop in the 
south referring to the republican national convention next august 
dole may just be whistling dixie as he tries to negotiate an 
electoral minefield that appears to favor vice president george 
bush 
there were two key events the first was new hampshire where a 
dole victory would have completely altered the picture in the south 
where bush has a strong organization and benefits from president 
reagans popularity 
but the kansas senator a big winner in iowa fell short in new 
hampshire and had to devise a strategy based on the assumption that 
bush will be the big popular vote winner on super tuesday 
the next test that could change the current outlook for march 8 
is the south carolina republican primary that occurs three days 
before super tuesday 
the name of the game now is delegates was the cry from dole 
aides 
eddie mahe a republican political consultant not involved with 
any presidential campaign agreed with that approach 
if i was advising any of these people i would say dont 
worry about the next days headline about who carried the popular 
vote in how many super tuesday states worry about the following 
days delegatecount story thats the story that counts he 
said 
its going to be relatively difficult for the bush forces to 
come out with much more than a bare majority at best the other 
delegates being split between robertson and dole said dole 
adviser david keene as the dole entourage flew south after his 
victories in the south dakota primary and minnesota caucuses on 
tuesday 
within 24 hours however keene and donald devine another 
senior campaign adviser were fired in a dispute with campaign 
manager william brock the former tennessee senator and secretary 
of labor 
but the strategy outlined by keene still appeared to offer the 
clearest hope for dole to survive until the campaign moves back to 
the midwest where he has trounced bush in three states 
bush and former television evangelist robertson look like the 
most formidable competitors in the south an assessment dole and 
his advisers do not dispute 
in addition to the southern and border states voting on super 
tuesday the schedule includes balloting in massachusetts rhode 
island nevada oklahoma and washington 
keene named north carolina oklahoma missouri washington and 
possibly florida as the states dole had the best chance to win 
on super tuesday thats not a very long list 
but most states elect their delegates by congressional districts 
and can be viewed as a series of district elections that means it 
is possible that while bush would easily carry the popular vote 
his rivals would carry a lot of districts and their delegates 
south carolina stands alone on march 5 and it is open to every 
registered voter in addition the democrats dont hold caucuses 
until a week later so there is no democratic contest to distract 
voters from the gop primary 
mahe said a lot of republicans dont see a lot of difference 
between bush and dole and also are very concerned about the 
possibility of robertson emerging as the nominee 
a robertson victory in south carolina could have a major impact 
on those voters 
people who genuinely have a sense of concern whether they 
should or they shouldnt about pat robertson who saw george bush 
lose again to pat robertson in south carolina where he had the 
governor going for him seemingly everything going for him they 
might say well maybe we ought to go with bob dole said mahe 
the same logic says that a bush victory in south carolina could 
open the gates for a big super tuesday win for the vice president 
dole has south carolina sen strom thurmond on his side and also 
supports legislation to limit textile imports a popular stand in a 
state where 45 percent of the jobs are in the textile industry 
bush opposes the bill 
dole has a similar advantage on a highly visible issue in 
louisiana where the kansan supports an oil import fee while bush 
opposes it glen beauerman doles campaign manager in louisiana 
said surveys say 70 percent of people in the oil and gas producing 
state support an import fee 
but its the robertson factor rather than issues that could keep 
bush from harvesting enough super tuesday delegates to make him 
unstoppable 
up and down east texas pat robertson is a real threat in a lot 
of districts said mahe but theres enough bushtype people in 
those districts for george to win all of them if they turn out and 
vote they have not been turning out in very good numbers

the political establishment is astonished over 
how easily republican presidential hopeful pat robertson has sown 
the wind without reaping the whirlwind 
political experts say a string of controversial pronouncements 
that would have damaged most politicians has only strengthened 
robertsons ties with his natural following conservative christian 
fundamentalists 
my guess is that pat is deliberately playing to his south 
carolina constituency says university of virginia sociologist 
jeffrey hadden a robertson biographer he doesnt care if folks 
in new york or chicago or los angeles think hes crazy at this 
point if he can get the press bashing him a bit it would help 
ignite his followers 
but republican consultant ed mahe disagrees i cant believe 
this reflects any kind of strategy what we have here is a 
talkshow host here who doesnt understand the power of talk after 
all when youre a talkshow host you toss these things out and who 
cares 
even ronald reagan who has often stood corrected ridiculed 
robertsons claim that his christian broadcasting network had 
information about the location of hostages in the middle east 
isnt it strange that no one in our administration was ever 
apprised of that asked the president at his news conference 
wednesday 
robertson bounced back saying he could not understand the big 
flap i used that as a throwaway line he said 
he also complained wednesday in the atlanta constitution that 
hes being put under undue scrutiny 
the press of the nation is holding me to an incredible 
standard of conduct he said they want me every time i open my 
mouth to be accompanied by a press aide a lawyer and a librarian 
with at least a thousand volumes to back up every word ive said 
just as robertsons campaign has weathered the hostage crisis 
this week it weathered the missile crisis earlier this month 
when robertson claimed there were soviet missiles in cuba 
the pentagon denied it the white house denied it even fidel 
castro denied it robertson shrugged off the outcry saying he 
hoped those doing the denying were right 
robertson also suggested he saw the sinister hand of vice 
president george bush behind the timing of the disclosures of 
sexual misbehavior by a fellow fundamentalist preacher jimmy 
swaggart and he accused television anchorman tom brokaw of 
engaging in religious bigotry when he referred to robertson a 
former television evangelist as a former television evangelist 
stephen hess a brookings institution student of the press and 
politics says robertsons ability to weather attacks on his 
credibility the teflon factor exists because the press has 
been easy on him 
the media gets tough on people when they become important 
he says 
adds larry sabato a political scientist at the university of 
virginia who has followed robertson for decades the other 
republican candidates are hesitant to attack him even bush his 
done so gingerly the republicans know they need his constituency 
in the fall they know these people are easily offended and will 
stay permanently offended 
moreover he says reporters with few evangelical christians in 
their ranks are shy about attacking robertson they know theyre 
subject to a charge of cultural bias 
at first he was getting a good press says hess there was 
a surprise about robertson we expected elmer gantry and instead we 
got robert young 
the more the press challenges robertson the more his natural 
constituency christian fundamentalists rallies around says 
anson shupe an indiana sociologist and coauthor with hadden of a 
forthcoming book televangelism power and politics in gods 
country 
hes playing to a different audience says shupe there is 
a real conspiratorial paranoid theme running through fundamental 
christianity they see the world almost as a conspiracy against 
christians what to someone else may look like a wayout statement 
plays a lot better with his following and may even help him 
but says shupe robertsons unproven statements will isolate 
robertson from mainstream voters ultimately this could be his 
upending he says

the senate energy committee approved 118 on 
thursday a bill that could open up for drilling a potentially 
oilrich section of the arctic national wildlife refuge in 
northeastern alaska 
the measure bitterly contested by environmentalists but eyed by 
industry as an oil bonanza rivaling the development of prudoe bay 
would authorize the interior department to open up 15 million 
acres on the coastal plain of the refuge which totals 19 million 
acres 
the energy committees approval followed a lengthy series of 
markup sessions in which various amendments designed to weaken or 
kill the legislation were turned back 
a day earlier the committee rejected 104 an attempt by sen 
wyche fowler dga to force oil companies to prove that 
exploratory drilling would not prove incompatible with the regions 
primary purpose as a fish and game refuge 
the interior department has estimated that there is a one in 
five chance that the northern tip of the refuge contains 
economically recoverable oil if there is any the department says 
its 5050 whether the amount totals more than 32 billion barrels 
and a 5 percent chance that it totals 9 billion barrels 
prudhoe bay contained a little more than 9 billion barrels when 
it was tapped in 1975 its now at peak production 18 million 
barrels a day and inevitably will start to decline soon 
the united states uses about 62 billion barrels a year so 32 
billion barrels would represent about 188 days worth 
the energy department calls the interior estimates conservative 
and the oil industry says the coastal area offers the best drilling 
prospect left in the united states the region is within 65 to 100 
miles of the alaska pipeline so extensive work would not be 
required to bring the oil to market 
the bill backed principally by chairman bennett johnston 
dla and frank murkowski ralaska faces a difficult floor fight 
in the senate and even more uncertain chances in the house where 
interior chairman morris udall dariz is a staunch opponent of 
disturbing the arctic refuge 
environmental groups such as the sierra club the wilderness 
society and the natural resources defense council are particularly 
disturbed about the potential effect of oil development on a herd 
of 180000 porcupine caribou whose calving grounds fall within the 
prime oil area 
sen bill bradley dnj told the senate committee that what 
is at stake is far more than the wellpublicized porcupine area 
caribou herd the coastal plain is also vital to polar bears 
grizzly bears wolverines and muskoxen the survivors of the ice 
age millions of swans snow geese northern pintail and other 
water fowl spend their summers on this stretch of the arctic 
coast

midnight was fast approaching as the 
twinengine plane flew at treetop level its lights and radio 
turned off into a combat zone in darkest angola 
with the small air strip illuminated only by kerosene lanterns 
set down moments before the plane landed at the stroke of midnight 
and out stepped of all people former virginia gov charles s 
robb 
since leaving office in 1985 robb has become an adventurer of 
sorts traveling to many a third world hot spot while attempting at 
the same time to encourage fellow democrats at home to embrace his 
cautiously hawkish foreign policy views 
robb clearly feels uncomfortable with the isolationist 
sentiments of some party leaders and he has been imploring 
democratic candidates to pursue a more traditionalist approach 
to international issues 
he would support any party candidate who gets the nomination but 
in a field dominated by liberals it is not surprising that robb 
finds sen albert gore of tennessee the most ideologically 
congenial of the lot 
robb himself is considered by some a possible candidate for 
national office one day but for now his principal shortterm 
ambition is election in november to the virginia senate seat being 
vacated by paul trible a republican 
if miles traveled are a qualification for election robb should 
win in a landslide 
he has been within earshot of hostile fire in iraq and along the 
afghanpakistan border his other wanderings seem like a travel 
agents dream japan korea the philippines the soviet union 
india oman bahrain kuwait saudi arabia israel nicaragua el 
salvador guatemala panama australia new zealand argentina 
chile brazil zaire ivory coast all of western europe and 
scandinavia this is a partial list 
to understand the stakes involved in a particular area robb 
said in a recent interview there is no substitute for actually 
being there no amount of reading or discussion he said could 
prepare him for the visual impact of the israeliheld golan heights 
and the degree to which israelis in the valley below would be 
vulnerable if it were returned to its historic owner syria 
to hear robb tell it few experiences were more rewarding than 
his visit last fall to angola where the sovietbacked government 
has been challenged for more than a decade by anticommunist rebels 
who receive us backing 
at the time the leader of the unita rebel group jonas savimbi 
was directing a military operation in mavinga a unita pilot flew 
robb there shutting off the lights and radio lest the flight be 
detected by loyalist forces manning antiaircraft equipment 
robb discussed military tactics with savimbi drawing on his own 
combat experience two decades ago in vietnam where he volunteered 
for service as a young marine officer after marrying lynda johnson 
daughter of president lyndon johnson 
robb spent five hours with savimbi before flying out in the 
predawn darkness 
his most memorable angolan experience was in jamba the unita 
headquarters and stronghold in southeastern angola there he saw 
hospitals with operating rooms a plant where captured soviet tanks 
were being rebuilt and a most remarkable education system 
involving thousands of children 
a prime robb interest these days is the state of the democratic 
party which he believes has lost its way in recent years partly 
because of too many comfortable assumptions about the intentions of 
americas adversaries 
i spend a lot of time trying to find ways to nudge our party 
and our presidential candidates to take what for me and for 
many other democrats would be regarded as a more responsible view 
on foreign policy he said 
robb goes to considerable lengths to avoid use of terms like 
conservative and liberal preferring such words as 
responsible 
i try not to put things in an ideological or philosophical 
context because i dont want to be constrained or restricted by a 
label he said i go to great lengths to avoid being 
pigeonholed 
on central america robb believes the reagan administration has 
overemphasized the need for military force while too many democrats 
underemphasize it he believes united states should support both 
the central american peace plan and the nicaraguan contras as well 
he said the democratic party has come a long way since 1984 a 
year when he felt that unswerving support for a nuclear freeze was 
a politically chic stand within the party but not among the public 
in the presidential election that year the democratic ticket 
carried one state 
were on more responsible ground now but we havent moved as 
far as we should have if were going to reoccupy the high ground 
that the party used to be able to occupy in previous decades 
robb said

before republicanhunting capitol police 
carried gop sen bob packwood onto the senate floor during 
filibuster of a campaign finance bill they found sen lowell p 
weicker jr sitting quietly in his office 
but the connecticut republican a political heavyweight in more 
ways than one was apparently too big for the posse led by senate 
sergeantatarms henry giugni to handle when they entered weickers 
office at 1245 am wednesday 
i think henry took a look at the 66 and 240 pounds and 
figured it was a long trip from the capitol rotunda to the senate 
floor weicker said thursday in a telephone interview i could 
see the wheels turning 
henry came in and indicated that i was arrested and i told 
him that was no time of day to arrest anybody and i was comfortably 
ensconced on my couch and had no intention of moving weicker 
said 
weicker quoted giugni as saying on his way out the door 
expletive i hate this job 
it was very good natured and there was no hint of 
confrontation other than there he had been here he was and here he 
was going to stay said weicker aide steve snider he and henry 
giugni know each other very well 
giugni did not return a series of telephone calls thursday an 
aide said he would no longer talk about the bizarre night 
packwood who was hauled off about 45 minutes later is seven 
inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than weicker 
the incident occurred when democrats angered that republicans 
were trying to filibuster a campaign finance reform bill without 
having a quorum on the senate floor ordered giugni to forcibly 
bring gop members to the chamber democratic sponsors of the bill 
have been unable to muster enough votes to end the filibuster

soviet troops headed home from 
east germany and czechoslovakia taking with them the first nuclear 
missiles dismantled under the superpower treaty scrapping 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
the soviet soldiers left two bases in east germany and one 
garrison in czechoslovakia thursday after a ceremonial sendoff 
highlighted in the communist countries staterun media 
both of moscows allies lauded the pullout of some shorterrange 
ss12 missiles as evidence of the kremlins sincere intent on peace 
czechoslovak radio said the soviet soldiers loaded missiles on a 
train thursday morning at the railway station at hranice a 
garrison town 180 miles southeast of prague 
battling driving snow the soviets loaded 19 missile launchers 
onto trains and then attended a ceremony at which they received 
decorations from the czechoslovak ministry of defense the radio 
said 
the soviet commander of the missile forces said the weapons were 
to be taken to an unspecified liquidation site in the soviet 
union he said they will not be destroyed until congress ratifies 
the treaty signed by mikhail gorbachev and president reagan last 
december in washington 
if the agreement is not ratified the responsible officials 
will decide about future steps lt col vyacheslav granovsky 
told the state news agency ctk 
the arms treaty covers nuclear missiles with ranges of between 
300 to 3100 miles the ss12 missiles known in the warsaw pact as 
otr22s have a range of 300 to 600 miles 
western diplomats expressed skepticism about thursdays 
ceremonies they said that until the superpower treaty goes into 
effect there are no formal provisions for verifying how many 
missiles were withdrawn 
until the arms treaty is in place there is no way of 
confirming what we are seeing and what we are being told is 
actually what it all appears to be said one western diplomat 
who spoke on condition he not be identified further 
in east germany western reporters were invited to bases at 
waren and bischofswerda where soviet soldiers were sent off with 
music speeches by local officials and gifts of flowers and candy 
from residents 
czechoslovak media said about 60 journalists watched the 
withdrawal from hranice but no western reporters were invited 
granovsky said that 39 ss12 missiles and 24 mobile launchers 
had been deployed in czechoslovakia after nato installed pershing 2 
and cruise missiles in western europe in 1983 it was the first 
time such figures were released 
nato installed its missiles to counteract soviet ss20 weapons 
stationed on soviet territory 
czechoslovak television showed film clips of snowdusted missile 
launchers being loaded onto rail cars for the ride back to the 
soviet union 
the commander of missile units and artillery lt gen jan 
krizan was quoted as saying that hranice a town of about 12500 
people was the only place where the ss12s were deployed 
krizan stressed that czechoslovakia has no nuclear weapons of 
its own 
missiles that had been based in the east german town of 
bischofswerda about 15 miles east of dresden also left on a train 
for the soviet union thursday 
western reporters saw a train loaded with about 32 containers 
leave bischofswerda 
a total of five launchers eight missiles and four practice 
missiles were stationed at the east german base but it was not 
known how many missiles left thursday 
at waren about 90 miles northwest of berlin there were 22 
missiles nine launchers and seven training rockets according to 
information released before the superpower treaty was signed

a us soldier was acquitted of desertion 
and given a bad conduct discharge for fleeing his west german base 
to live in the soviet union shocking prosecutors who had expected 
him to do prison time 
courtroom spectators mostly military personnel gasped when 
presiding judge col earl pauley ordered pfc wade e roberts 22 
of riverside calif released from military custody thursday 
i feel great roberts said after he was convicted of a 
lesser charge of being absent without leave and given a bad conduct 
discharge 
roberts described by a superior as the most reprehensible 
casual soldier in his command but as confused by his 
attorneys said he will live in west germany with his wife petra 
neumann and their 3monthold son 
the military pressed hard for a conviction of desertion during 
the 1day courtmartial at fort dix that offense carries a maximum 
penalty of a dishonorable discharge and three years imprisonment 
im shocked said capt daniel shaver chief military 
attorney he said the army expected roberts to be sentenced to the 
maximum awol penalty of a dishonorable discharge and one years 
imprisonment 
when the sentence was read roberts and his attorneys broke into 
wide grins and the soldier and his wife embraced and kissed 
shavers jaw dropped and he stared at the judge 
to prove desertion the army had to demonstrate that when 
roberts left his base at giessen west germany last february he 
never intended to return to the army 
the prosecution produced a halfdozen witnesses in an effort to 
show roberts didnt like the army talked about leaving didnt get 
along with his superiors and had disciplinary problems 
but roberts attorneys argued their client fled his unit because 
was harassed by his superiors for among other things dating ms 
neumann because she was german 
when he took the stand thursday roberts told how one of his 
sergeants told him to stay away from german women roberts said he 
panicked because he didnt want to leave ms neumann and 
scaled a fence at the base 
when they went to the soviet union they were put to work on a 
snake farm but quickly became disenchanted with soviet life 
after getting soviet approval roberts and his wife flew to 
frankfurt west germany on nov 4 and was told by a us embassy 
official to turn himself over to the military the next day before 
he could however he was arrested by the army 
roberts civilian attorney ronald kuby asked for lenient 
treatment private wade roberts is not cut out for the army he 
doesnt need the army the army doesnt need him kuby said 
roberts returned to the philadelphia naval yard brig where he 
has been held for the past several months to pick up his 
belongings and went to an undisclosed location with ms neumann

the reagan administration is proposing that 
states with approved groundwater protection plans be given 
discretion to permit use of some pesticides that otherwise would be 
banned 
the proposal was unveiled thursday in the form of a draft 
strategy released for public comment 
groundwater provides drinking water for half the us population 
and for 97 percent of people living in rural areas epa says it 
expects to complete a survey in 1990 on the extent of contamination 
epa licenses new pesticides and is gradually relicensing all 
the old ones as it makes those licensing decisions it tries to 
take into account the chemicals ability to leach into groundwater 
which can depend on many things including soil permeability and 
application method 
epa expects to ban the use of some chemicals in specific states 
or counties while allowing use in others the new strategy is 
designed to allow states facing such bans to overturn them provided 
they show that groundwater supplies will not be contaminated 
significantly 
john a moore epas assistant administrator for pesticides and 
toxic substances said the agencys ability to do something at 
these levels counties and below is not good 
states with plans could employ geological land use crop 
pattern and water data to justify decisions that would run counter 
to epa determinations 
where found appropriate epa would consider modifying the 
federal registration to accommodate the state program the agency 
said 
in making decisions both epa and the states would use current 
drinking water standards where they exist for chemicals that 
dont cause cancer for carcinogens the agency would permit 
contamination to a level that would mean a oneinamillion chance 
of cancer over a lifetime 
if there are no drinking water standards only six have been 
established for pesticides with another 10 in the pipeline then 
epa would determine the permissible pesticide concentration in 
groundwater supplies 
though several other federally mandated environmental programs 
are run by states one example is strip mine reclamation moore 
acknowledged that there are no good models of states being 
allowed to make exceptions to federal rules like what epa is 
proposing for pesticides 
he said epa would periodically revisit and reassure ourselves 
that what the state had put together was being maintained moore 
said 
he singled out california iowa illinois wisconsin and florida 
as states with active pesticidegroundwater programs generally 
combining state agriculture health and environmental protection 
departments 
moore said he expected cooperation from farmers and their trade 
groups if theres been one area where i havent had to convince 
the user community they should pay attention this is it its 
their wells and their children drinking the water moore said 
pesticide contamination of groundwater is a relatively new 
issue and as recently as 10 years ago most government officials 
and scientists believed it didnt happen they thought the 
chemicals didnt last long enough or penetrate far enough down 
the first serious contamination cases were reported in new york 
and california in 1979 
two years ago epa said 19 pesticides had been found in 
groundwater in 24 states today said patrick holden team leader 
of the groundwater project in epas pesticides office 50 to 60 
different chemicals have been found in wells in 30 states iowa has 
found pesticides in half the wells serving cities 
pesticides are not the only contaminants fertilizers waste 
disposal wells and leaking underground tanks all can contribute 
substantially 
epa plans to adopt a groundwater strategy that would require 
states to classify supplies known as aquifers in a threetier 
priority system high priority protection drinking water sources 
and water needing little protection 
many environmentalists object to the plan saying it would write 
off a substantial percentage of groundwater supplies 
sen david durenberger rminn on thursday introduced at least 
the 10th bill this session calling for minimum federal standards 
for all aquifers 
the senator said he would have to study epas proposal for the 
states an aide jimmie powell said that to the extent you can 
manage pesticides for their leaching ability it could be a 
reasonable proposal to let states make detailed areaspecific 
management decisions along the lines epa is proposing 
but rick hind of the us public interest research group said 
epas use of a oneinamillion standard for carcinogens is too 
soft he also said the drinking water standards for 
noncarcinogens is based partly on the cost of cleaning it up 
and thus inappropriate for a strategy of protecting public health

the outlook for us farm exports continues to 
improve as the soviet union begins a new round of corn purchases 
overall the agriculture department says the value of us 
agricultural exports will rise to a fouryear high of 325 billion 
in the 1988 fiscal year that began oct 1 
spurred by recent heavy sales of grain to the soviet union and 
china partly under a special export subsidy program the new 1988 
forecast is up 500 million from 32 billion indicated on dec 17 
steve macdonald of the departments economic research service 
said the soviet union may account for 17 billion of the total 
export value this year the most since 1985 when moscows purchases 
totaled 25 billion soviet purchases last year were valued at 
about 700 million 
chinas us purchases are expected to be around 500 million 
more than double the 200 million of 1987 he said 
the new export forecast came thursday as the department 
announced another cash sale of corn to the soviet union the second 
in two days 
with a shipment value of 32 billion this years exports would 
be up 16 percent from 279 billion in 1987 and 24 percent from a 
decade low of 263 billion in 1986 agricultural exports were 
valued at 312 billion in fiscal 1985 and 38 billion in 1984 
most of the increase from the earlier estimate stems from 
additional wheat sales under the export enhancement program the 
department said since the december forecast eep offers were 
announced for 2 million metric tons of wheat to the soviet union 
and 12 million tons to china among others 
under the eep arrangement private exporters get free surplus 
commodities from the agriculture department as subsidies so they 
can sell grain and other products overseas at reduced prices 
on the basis of actual volume 1988 exports were indicated at 
1425 million metric tons up from 141 million forecast in december 
and 1292 million tons shipped last year 
the us share of the world market particularly in grains and 
cotton is rising officials said in their report relatively 
low world prices and improved us competitiveness through lower 
price support loan rates the eep and a lower dollar have reduced 
production incentives for foreign competitors 
meanwhile private exporters reported the sales of 601600 tons 
of corn for delivery to the soviet union this year under a 
longterm supply agreement between the two countries 
on wednesday the soviets bought 350000 tons of corn the first 
substantial amount since last october corn sales are not qualified 
for eep subsidies however 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 601600 tons of 
corn would be about 24 million bushels having a farm value of 
around 44 million at recent prices of about 182 per bushel

shipments of federally inspected reindeer 
steaks across the country would be allowed under a proposal being 
considered by the agriculture department 
there is mandatory federal inspection of cattle hogs chickens 
and turkeys at slaughter plants which allows those carcasses to be 
shipped across state lines 
in addition regulations permit the voluntary inspection of 
certain exotic animals slaughtered for human food those include 
the american bison or buffalo and the cattalo a cross between 
cattle and the buffalo 
lester m crawford head of the departments food safety and 
inspection service said thursday producers of exotic animals have 
asked the inspection list be expanded to include reindeer elk 
deer antelope and water buffalo 
this proposal is a response to their request and could 
facilitate the sale and export of the carcasses meat and meat food 
products from these animals he sad once the animals and 
products are inspected and passed they can be sold interstate or 
exported 
producers of the animals would pay fees to receive the optional 
inspection service crawford said fewer than 2000 exotic animals 
are slaughtered annually at the present time and that the slaughter 
level is not expected to increase much if the exotic list is 
expanded 
by comparison he said annual cattle slaughter has been running 
at more than 32 million head 
public comments on the proposal can be sent by april 26 to

united airlines inc has paid an 11000 civil 
penalty to settle 1987 charges by the agriculture department that 
it violated federal transportation standards for shipments of live 
animals 
the penalty was assessed by the department in an administrative 
action stemming from nine shipments of dogs and monkeys in 1985 and 
1986 a complaint was filed against united last year by the 
departments animal and plant health inspection service which 
administers the animal welfare act 
james w glosser acting administrator of the agency said 
thursday the complaints alleged that united had accepted dogs in 
shipping kennels that did not conform to size requirement and that 
the airline either failed to observe and care for the dogs 
properly or stowed them in cargo space without sufficient 
ventiliation 
two dogs died during shipment and another was killed by highway 
traffic after it escaped shipment glosser said the airline also 
was cited for having allegedly accepted a shipment of 50 monkeys 
in cages that were not structurally sound and had no markings to 
tell they contained wild animals he said 
glosser said united also consented to an order against future 
violations of the act and agreed within a year to buy a training 
film approved by usda and show it to all employees who handle live 
animal cargoes

michael dukakis urged by his aides to begin 
returning campaign fire says democratic presidential rival richard 
gephardt better watch out if he persists with his sharp attacks 
in the battle for the partys nomination 
ive been in negative campaigns before and i can tell you if 
people want to be negative i know what to do the massachusetts 
governor said thursday as he opened a threeday campaign trip 
through dixie 
i hope we dont go down that road he said adding that 
negative attacks during the nominating battle would only damage 
democrats chances of capturing the white house 
dukakis issued his warning one day after gephardt unleashed a 
stinging attack the latest in a string that the governors aides 
believe may be taking a toll the missouri congressman said dukakis 
and tennessee sen albert gore jr had hardly a dimes worth of 
difference on economic issues 
gephardt said dukakis foreign policy experience consisted 
mostly of negotiating with the governor of new hampshire over the 
use of nuclear power 
and he summarized dukakis campaign bitingly calling him the 
candidate with the most money and the least message 
gephardt also has attacked dukakis in television commercials 
yet with the campaign in an intensive phase leading to the 21 
super tuesday primaries and caucuses set for march 8 dukakis so 
far has declined to respond with anything approaching the vehemence 
used by gephardt 
instead he has replied with indirect attacks and issued a 
series of increasingly stern warnings 
if people want to get negative ive had experience with 
negative campaigns he said at a news conference in boca raton 
fla if youve got a record as vulnerable as his is youd better 
watch out thats all i can say 
the massachusetts governor also chided gore and gephardt for 
going at each other in a mananer resembling republican 
presidential rivals george bush and bob dole 
i dont think this prince of darkness routine is going to 
sell he said 
but some aides say they believe that negative television 
commercials played a role in gephardts victory in the south dakota 
primary on tuesday a conclusion also reinforced by some public 
opinion polls 
and with the critical southern primaries approaching the 
governor is getting advice to respond more sharply to gephardt 
we have to knock this negative campaigning out of the box 
said s stephen rosenfeld florida campaign manager for dukakis 
my own view is that it comes home to roost but weve got to make 
it come home to roost for gephardt sooner rather than later 
rosenfeld said he has told dukakis as much and the governor 
made it very clear that its important to respond 
but so far dukakis has passed up every opportunity 
when he and gephardt shared a stage to discuss longterm health 
care before a group of senior citizens his most biting comment was 
a mild jab 
askdd if he had flipflopped on the issue dukakis replied 
theres the flipflopper over there im not the flipflopper

a railroad rate case initiated eight years ago 
by a group of montana farmers may play a pivotal role in the way 
the interstate commerce commission determines when certain shippers 
are being overcharged 
the case involves captive shippers who must rely on a single 
railroad for transporting their goods in this case wheat and 
barley being sent from montana to shipping points along the 
northwest coast 
the icc earlier this month concluded that the burlington 
northern railroad had overcharged the farmers and directed that the 
railroad make refunds as much as 30 million according to some 
estimates and use a new method to determine fair rates 
the montana ruling known as the mccarty farms case after one of 
the farmers is being appealed by the burlington northern it may 
not be settled until it goes to the us supreme court say both 
railroad and shipping experts familiar with the case 
but if it stands the case may spawn a new method of determining 
when captive shippers are being overcharged 
the mccarty case is the first attempt to do this in a live 
case said daniel campbell the iccs deputy general counsel 
if weve done it successfully and its accepted by the courts it 
has implications for other captive shippers 
in the montana case the icc sought to establish a shorthand 
approach to determining whether a shipper is being overcharged by 
comparing a railroads revenue to its operating costs 
the icc already has used the same method of determining an 
overcharge in a case involving generators being shipped for 
westinghouse corp and shipments of sugar according to icc 
officials 
but neither the railroads nor groups representing shipping 
interests are particularly happy about the methods the icc 
developed in the montana case 
it sets up a very nasty test for any future shippers 
suggested mark cooper research director for the consumer 
federation of america who has studied railroad ratemaking as it 
applies to captive shippers 
cooper said he is concerned that in the montana case the icc 
decided to use average rates when determining whether the montana 
farmers were being charged too much 
if the same practice is used in other ratemaking cases shippers 
who are being charged exceedingly high rates might be denied relief 
because they are lumped in with other shippers whose rates are 
lower suggested cooper 
other critics say the montana case exemplifies the problems a 
shipper faces in challenging railroad rates 
the case is an absolute modern horror story maintains 
robert szabo the executive director of the consumers union for 
rail equity it has taken these farmers seven years and 
they spent over a million dollars 
szabos group known as cure has been battling the railroads 
for years on behalf of primarily coal companies and electric 
utilities over rates to captive shippers 
with the montana case suggests szabo the icc has tried to head 
off continuing criticism in congress that the icc has been moving 
too slowly to deal with shipper grievances 
spokesmen for the association of american railroads declined to 
comment on the case except to reiterate its position before the icc 
that it opposed using the new procedure to determine maximum rates 
and that it did not consider the burlington norther rates excessive 
the montana case began in 1980 when richard mccarty a grain 
farmer from near plentywood mont and a few other farmers filed a 
class action suit accusing burlington northern of price gouging in 
shipping crops to west coast markets 
a federal judge referred the case to the icc where an 
administrative law judge ruled in 1981 that the farmers qualified 
for relief under the staggers act which deregulated much of the 
railroad industry in 1980 the icc concluded the case feb 12

the face had changed and some views were 
different but senators might have imagined robert h bork was back 
when they held a confirmation hearing for the most controversial 
judicial nominee before them 
bernard siegan nominee for the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals spent his confirmation hearing thursday defending what one 
senator called his remarkably extreme views bork did the same 
during confirmation hearings on his supreme court nomination 
and like bork siegan pledged over and over that he would cast 
his personal constitutional views aside if confirmed and follow 
supreme court precedent 
so did bork 
the players were the same too in the senate judiciary 
committee hearing room 
liberal sens howard m metzenbaum dohio and patrick j 
leahy dvt both major opponents of bork were highly critical of 
siegan a 63yearold professor of constitutional law at the 
university of san diego 
conservative sens orrin g hatch rutah and charles grassley 
riowa two of borks most ardent backers jumped to siegans 
defense 
and people for the american way the civil libertian group that 
ran a controversial antibork television spot narrated by gregory 
peck promptly issued a news release attacking siegan 
siegan the group said spent the morning distancing himself 
from his entire body of legal scholarship 
siegans views do not always parallel those of bork but he is 
just as controversial 
he wrote that the supreme court reached the right conclusion in 
outlawing school segregation but used faulty reasoning he said 
prayer in schools could be constitutional although the supreme 
court has said otherwise he gave equal weight to property rights 
and human rights and he said the framers of the 14th amendment 
which governs due process rights never intended its scope to be as 
broad as that defined by the supreme court 
leahy who conducted the confirmation hearing because committee 
chairman joseph biden jr ddel is recuperating from brain 
surgery said afterward that siegans almost total lack of 
experience in the courtroom and his remarkably extreme views 
make him one of the more difficult ones for the senate to 
approve 
the last time you were in federal court i was 12 years old 
leahy said 
asked about siegans promises to follow supreme court precedent 
leahy said there is a feeling there may be a confirmation 
conversion here too 
the senator used the same term during borks hearing accusing 
the nominee of changing many of his controversial positions in 
order to win confirmation bork proved to be unconvincing and the 
senate rejected his nomination 5842 
in many ways bork would be easier to accept because he had 
judicial experience and federal court experience leahy said 
during the hearing hatch listed many of siegans controversial 
writings and repeatedly gave the nominee the chance to say he 
would observe the law of the land and resign if unable to do so 
i hope people will give you a fair shake hatch said 
the 9th circuit on which new supreme court justice anthony 
kennedy served covers alaska arizona california hawaii idaho 
montana nevada oregon washington guam and the northern mariana 
islands 
siegan told the committee there are times i will rule 
contrary to my own feelings it would be a direct violation and 
contrary of my oath to push my position ahead of the supreme 
court 
metzenbaum told siegan im concerned that if confirmed you 
will find a way to implement your views circuit courts are often 
the courts of last resort he said there would be a great 
risk if the senate confirmed siegan 
siegan said his lack of courtroom experience would not be a 
problem commenting a circuit court judge is given scholarly 
duties to see if what the lower court did was right i have spent 
20 years of my life in scholarly activities even a lawyer with 
trial experience may not know how to write an opinion

the national highway traffic safety board is 
asking general motors corp to explain why its engineers withdrew a 
recommendation that 703225 cars be recalled because of possible 
sudden acceleration problems 
the center for auto safety a consumers group often at odds with 
the automakers and their regulators contends that the engineers 
were pressured to change their position gm has denied the 
allegation 
nhtsa is asking gm to describe the companys product problem 
evaluation committee in flint mich which made the recommendation 
a nhtsa letter released thursday also asked gm to state whether 
the committee memo withdrawing the recall recommendation 
constitutes a legitimate ppec report 
nhtsa is investigating alleged throttle problems that produce 
sudden acceleration in the 198687 oldsmobile delta 88 and buick 
lesabre and the 1987 pontiac bonneville 
the agency has received 573 complaints of alleged sudden 
acceleration in the cars resulting in reports of 343 accidents 
145 injuries and one death said joe collins nhtsa spokesman none 
of the reports has been substantiated by the agency collins said 
gm spokesman david hudgens said it was preposterous to 
suggest the engineers were pressured 
we dont do business that way hudgens said 
the automaker was preparing a response to nhtsa hudgens said 
in the nhtsa letter and our response the question of pressure 
doesnt come up he said 
the center for auto safety said the engineers decision to 
withdraw their recall recommendation was suspicious because it came 
just 18 days before gm would have had to tell nhtsa of the 
recommendation 
the timing suggests the clear possibility that the gm 
engineers change of heart may have been less than voluntary the 
center said in a petition to nhtsa 
nhtsa declined to comment on the gm investigation citing agency 
policy 
the gm memo part of the public record of the nhtsa engineering 
analysis was in the form of a twopage handwritten note dated oct 
23 1987 saying withdraw recommendation for lack of data 
support of a trend or high frequency on one page and withdraw 
recommendation to conduct field actions on throttle cables on all 
cars for lack of data to conclude there is a problem on the other 
the committee on aug 24 1987 had recommended a recall

the reagan administration on thursday night 
greeted with caution news that the president of panama has ousted 
military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said administration 
officials want to reiterate our unqualified support for civilian 
constitutional rule in panama 
there is but one legitimate sovereign authority in panama and 
that is the panamanian people exercising their democratic right to 
vote and elect their leadership in a free society fitzwater said 
in a formal statement released not long reports surfaced from 
panama city saying that president eric arturo delvalle had 
dismissed noriega 
there was no immediate comment from the white house or state 
department early friday after the panamas legislative assembly 
removed delvalle and the vice president from office 
a senior us official said that as of thursday night the major 
unanswered question was whether noriega would attempt to fight his 
ouster 
initial reports indicated that noriega did not intend to go 
quietly the official said citing a television newscast in panama 
in which a member of the defense forces said that if anyone is 
removed from power it should be delvalle 
the official insisting on anonymity said it was his 
understanding that col marcos justine noriegas designated 
successor is almost as tainted by corrupt activities as is noriega 
sen alphonse damato rny who participated in a 
congressional investigation of noreiga said us military 
intervention might be in order to support panamas civilian 
government if noriega decides to cling to power or attempts a coup 
but he said he has no indication whether the reagan 
administration might initiate military action against noreiga or 
act on any request from delvalle 
were not without leverage damato said in an interview 
there are 10000 us troops under arms in panama guarding the 
panama canal 
i am suggesting that there have been times in the past when we 
have been asked to intervene by a legitimate government damato 
said i dont think we should write off that possibility thats 
a very real option 
at the pentagon a spokeswoman said the us southern command in 
panama had issued a personnel movement alert thursday night as 
a precaution 
capt nancy laluntas said the command had issued a bravo 
alert which orders american military personnel and dependents to 
decrease their visibility 
a bravo alert specifies that some civil disturbance activity 
is probable reduce the amount of time spent in public areas of 
panama if you do not live on a defense site or military area of 
coordination stay around your residence unless traveling to and 
from work or conducting personal business in a nonaffected area 
laluntas said there are two higher levels of alert one which 
orders travel to be confined to essential business and another 
which suspends travel 
she said the us southern command in panama had received 
reports of scattered demonstrations in and around panama city 
us personnel are also being reminded that under the 
terms of the panama canal treaty we are not to interfere in the 
internal affairs of panama she said 
delvalles move was applauded on capitol hill but with some 
reservation 
rep charles rangel dny head of the house select committee 
on narcotics abuse and control said he believed the delvalle move 
was a direct result of noriegas indictment in the united states on 
drug charges 
that was a foreign policy objective but we used our justice 
department to do it rangel said thats not the normal way to 
do things are we going to conduct foreign policy by 
indictment 
sen edward m kennedy dmass called delvalles action 
courageous 
it is constitutional and it deserves the support of 
freedomloving people throughout this hemisphere kennedy said 
there is no doubt about the wishes of the panamanian people 
president delvalle must be supported and gen noreiga must go 
if gen noreiga persists in power he will become an outcast 
now and for all time in panama and throughout the world 
kennedy said 
sen john kerry dmass called the announcement very 
important news and said the united states should be prepared to 
help delvalle 
i think we have a number of options said kerry chairman of 
a foreign relations subcommittee which held hearings earlier this 
month on noriegas involvement in drug trafficking 
the first option for the congress of the united states to 
immediately move to a full economic embargo of the country 
hopefully the business community and others in panama who 
recognize the impossibility of surviving in that situation and 
noriega himself will find it impossible for him to govern 
during a nationally broadcast news conference wednesday night 
president reagan when asked whether the united states would 
consider dropping the federal indictment if noriega stepped aside 
replied 
no and im not going to comment on something of this kind 
this man has been indicted by a federal grand jury and so im not 
going to make any comment of that kind nor have we made any 
advances or suggestions of that kind to the government of panama 
reagan said that what we would like to see is a return to 
democracy and a civilian government in panama and not this 
domination by literally a military dictator

boredom peer pressure and bad management 
create a climate for widespread drug and alcohol use by the 
nations railroad workers two crewmen involved in last years 
fatal amtrak crash say 
the former conrail workers told the senate commerce committee on 
thursday of coworkers who consumed as much as a case of beer a 
day brought bottles of liquor to work or used marijuana cocaine 
amphetamines and other drugs 
overall drinking was encouraged on the job especially when i 
was hired on said ricky l gates who was the engineer of the 
three connected conrail locomotives that on jan 4 1987 collided 
with a crowded amtrak passenger train 
sixteen people were killed and 175 injured in the accident the 
worst in amtrak history which occurred in chase md 
gates an admitted alcoholic and brakeman edward w cromwell 
have admitted to smoking marijuana in the locomotive cab shortly 
before the accident 
gates was charged with 16 counts of manslaughter but was allowed 
to plead guilty to just one count in a plea agreement feb 16 
he faces sentencing march 29 cromwell who testified 
separately was prepared to testify in court against gates and was 
not charged in the disaster 
the conrail engines went through a stop signal and into the path 
of the new yorkbound amtrak train the national transportation 
safety board has blamed the accident on marijuana use 
gates told the panel that he believed 10 percent or 20 percent 
of rail workers drink or use drugs on duty cromwell said the 
figure was more like 40 percent or 50 percent 
the two men also said that when they began their railroad 
careers 14 years ago as many as 80 percent of their fellow 
employees used drugs or alcohol during working hours 
at times you may be sitting in a caboose for 12 hours without 
even a wheel turning cromwell said the boredom of the job 
together with the lack of concern from some supervisors makes it a 
common thing for some employees to drink or smoke marijuana while 
on duty 
gates 33 said that once years ago he was forced to report 
to work even though he told the official who telephoned him that he 
was drunk he said a friend had to drive him to work after he was 
told that if he did not report he would be cited for refusin duty 
unless a climate is created where it is acceptable to come 
forward and seek treatment the employee assistance program that 
some railroads have will not work gates said that climate 
does not exist in the rail industry 
daniel w collins assistant general secretary of the united 
transportation union told the committee that perhaps 10 percent of 
rail workers on duty or subject to being called in to work are 
under the influence of drugs or alcohol 
he said the estimates that 80 percent of workers used drugs or 
drank years ago have never been true in the history of the 
industry 
spokeswoman carol perkins of the american association of 
railroads said in an interview that rail workers had the same 
percentage of alcohol or drug use as the rest of society 
railroads have improved their policies and are more sensitive 
to the problem perkins said 
the senate has approved a bill that would require several types 
of drug and alcohol testing for railroad airline truck and bus 
industry workers the house has yet to approve similar legislation 
the most controversial types of testing are examinations of 
randomly chosen workers 
supporters say it is the best way to deter drug and alcohol use 
opponents led by labor unions and civil liberties groups say it 
could be abused by management officials out to get particular 
workers and is an invasion of privacy 
the government already has rules allowing some testing of rail 
workers but not random tests

martin luther king jr after the impeachment trial of gov evan 
mecham 
i promised the acting governor rose mofford that after the 
trials over thatll be one of the first things well try to do 
senate government committee chairman john mawhinney said thursday 
mecham who rescinded the states first king holiday in 1987 
goes on trial monday in the senate on a 23count impeachment 
accused of concealing a campaign loan misusing state funds and 
trying to thwart an investigation 
acting gov mofford supports a federalstyle king holiday and 
lawmakers narrowed their focus on thursday when the senate rejected 
a proposal to have voters decide whether to create a paid king 
holiday 
the vote leaves untouched two other measures more acceptable to 
supporters of the holiday a straight federalstyle holiday and a 
cafeteria bill that would late state workers pick a certain 
number of holidays froom a list 
the states republicancontrolled legislature killed king 
holiday proposals for a number of years citing the estimated 3 
million cost of a paid holiday for state employees 
then democrat bruce babbitt about to launch a presidential 
campaign decided in 1986 to end his term as governor by bypassing 
the legislature and creating a paid king holiday through executive 
proclamation 
mecham babbitts successor promptly rescinded the order in 
1987 citing an attorney generals advisory opinion that only 
lawmakers or voters not governors could declare such holidays 
mechams decision triggered international boycotts of the state 
by musicians and convention groups and the house approved a 
federalstyle king holiday last year only to see the measure die 
in committee

house democrats and house republicans are 
offering different reasons for why a vote on the democratic plan to 
send 305 milllion in aid to the nicaraguan contras was postponed 
until next week 
democrats say they wanted time to explain better how the package 
differs from a rival republican version republicans sa the 
democrats feared the package would have lost if had been voted on 
thursday as originally scheduled 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said he planned to bring the 
measure before the chamber for a vote next thursday and both sides 
appeared likely to continue to finetune their aid packages to pick 
up votes 
too many members have complained that they dont know whats 
in it wright said thursday 
the democratic version includes some 16 million in food 
clothing shelter and medical aid to the rebels fighting 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and 14 million to set 
up a medical aid fund for children who are victims of that 
countrys sevenyear civil war 
current aid to the rebels which includes authority for the cia 
to deliver previously stockpiled weapons and ammunition ends feb 
29 
but the house gop leader robert michel of illinois said the 
scheduled vote this week was postponed because democrats feared 
they would lose the republican package would have been approved 
and that would have aced out the speaker 
the 36 million republican plan offered somewhat more aid to the 
rebels included nonlethal military items like jeeps and radios 
and adopted the democratic plans call for a childrens survival 
fund 
but the primary difference between the two proposals lay in the 
conditions they set for the next showdown over a military aid 
proposal that both sides expect president reagan to offer later 
this year 
democrats want to make any future military aid proposal 
contingent on a finding by the house intelligence committee 
sometime after june 1 that the two warring sides in nicaragua have 
not agreed to a ceasefire because the sandinistas did not make 
goodfaith efforts 
if such a determination is made the new aid package would be 
designed and controlled by the house democratic leadership there 
would be no guarantee that the package would be offered or if it 
were that the senate would be forced to act quickly on it 
but the gop version would leave the determination of whether to 
offer a new aid proposal up to reagan and would contain much 
stricter rules to make sure the package would be quickly acted on 
in both the house and the senate the president could act anytime 
after april 15 under this version 
rep tony coelho of california the chief house democratic vote 
counter said failure by congress to pass some form of aid would 
increase pressure for a vote later in the year on more weapons for 
the contras

the nations largest airports would have to 
install new security systems to screen the movements of airport and 
airline workers under regulations the government is drafting the 
secretary of transportation says 
the secretary james h burnley iv told congress on thursday 
that the proposed regulations should be ready reasonably 
quickly and would take effect after allowing the airports time 
to install the equipment 
under the new system employees would carry magnetized 
identification cards similar to automatic teller cards 
computercontrolled gates set up throughout the airports would 
admit only certain workers during specified hours and could be 
programmed to bar admission to people who leave their airport jobs 
you can deprogram a person out limiting access to certain 
areas burnley told the senate transportation appropriations 
subcommittee 
he did not mention a cost or say how many airports would be 
affected a similar system is already in use at washington dulles 
international airport 
last dec 7 a fired usair employee boarded a pacific southwest 
airlines jet after flashing his expired identification card to 
airport security workers and shot his former boss and the planes 
crew in flight the aircraft bound to san francisco from los 
angeles crashed in central california killing all 44 people on 
board 
burnley said he ordered the faa to begin writing the new airport 
security rule before christmas 
in other testimony the secretary said the faa will not be able 
to meet the congressionally mandated level of 10450 fully trained 
air traffic controllers by sept 30 instead he projects that 
9932 socalled fullperformance level controllers will be at work 
at that date 
he also said his agency is talking with the air force which 
plans to reduce its work force because of budget constraints about 
hiring air traffic controllers who lose jobs there 
he also repeated the reagan administrations refusal to rehire 
any of the controllers fired after their 1980 strike saying 
they not only broke the law they left the american people very 
much in the lurch 
the government plans to have a total of 15900 air traffic 
controllers at work by sept 30 including trainees and 
supervisors it usually takes three to four years for a newly hired 
controller to reach fullperformance level

justice department officials have been 
directed to polarize the debate on key legal questions this 
year including aids which an internal memo says is not a civil 
rights or privacy issue 
the document says issues such as aids and drugs should be 
discussed not as questions of individual rights but as public 
health or safety issues 
the memo was sent monday to various justice department officials 
under the initials of william bradford reynolds the counselor to 
attorney general edwin meese iii reynolds also is assistant 
attorney general in charge of the civil rights division 
we must polarize the debate it says we must not seek 
consensus we must confront of course we must confront 
sensibly in ways designed to win the debate and further our 
agenda 
the memo was adopted from a document assembled several months 
ago by terry eastland the departments director of public affairs 
who said he wrote it to stimulate discussion on how to approach 
various justice department issues 
the contents of the memo were disclosed in thursday editions of 
the baltimore sun and subsequently confirmed by eastland 
the document recommends that the death penalty be defended as 
necessary for deterrence retribution and incapacitation ie 
decapitation 
eastland said the department is not in favor of decapitation as 
a method of capital punishment but that he used the word to make 
incapacitation seem less abstract and professorial 
the memo says that aids is not a civil rights or privacy 
issue but one of public health and safety and recommends that 
the department press lawsuits that seek to counter the privacy 
advocates who challenge aids testing 
regarding obscenity it says that the department must attack 
the idea that those trafficking in it have a right to practice 
their trade it suggests that public health laws building codes 
and health and safety rules be used to attack obscenity along with 
laws making sale of obscene items a crime 
entitled a strategy for the remaining months the document 
says the drug issue should be confronted by advocating a tough 
approach emphasizing strong law enforcement and drug testing as 
opposed to the soft easy way that emphasizes drug treatment and 
rehabilitation 
the memo supports construction of more prisons instead of 
alternatives to imprisonment and says that to polarize the issue 
we must attack those by name such as sen paul simon who take the 
other approach simon is a democratic presidential candidate

george bushs characterization of republican 
presidential rival bob dole as a supporter of tax increases is 
unlikely to work as it did in new hampshire because dole is more 
vigilant now political and economics analysts say 
larry sabato a university of virginia political scientist said 
bushs new hampshire commercial depicting dole as straddling the 
tax issue succeeded only because the kansas senator chose not to 
respond to it 
martin anderson a domestic policy adviser during president 
reagans first term said the vice president damaged doles chances 
in new hampshire with the ad raising doubts about the kansas 
senators tax intentions but anderson also said that dole did 
himself in by refusing to accept pete du ponts debate challenge to 
sign a notax pledge 
economist barry bosworth of the liberaloriented brookings 
institution said bushs accusations about dole are specious but 
said the vice president adroitly played to an issue of great 
sensitivity to people worried about their pocketbooks 
i think dole has learned from that new hampshire loss and 
you probably wont see this happen again bosworth said in an 
interview 
several economists and political analysts were asked whether 
bush would be able to campaign successfully in the ensuing months 
as an opponent of tax increases while characterizing dole as a 
taxhike proponent 
bush has no record dole has a record which includes both 
revenue increases in concert with the reagan administration and 
deficit reduction said bob mcintyre of the private group 
citizens for tax justice 
the question of whether bush will be able to score political 
points out of the tax issue arose in the wake of the vice 
presidents successful use in new hampshire of a television 
commercial which raised doubts about doles tax intentions 
in the aftermath of his loss in new hampshire dole acknowledged 
that he should have responded immediately to bushs ads and on 
thursday dole announced the departure from his campaign staff of 
consultants david keene and donald devine 
a check of the republican presidential candidates records shows 
that while bush succeeded in raising doubts in peoples minds about 
doles stance on taxes neither man has a record of unqualified 
opposition to tax hikes 
bush last november muted his disagreement with a 
deficitreduction package in which president reagan and 
congressional leaders including dole signed a compact aimed at 
slashing the federal deficit by 76 billion over the next two 
years in part with 22 billion in tax increases 
bush seemed to dissent when he told a crowd in iowa that while 
he didnt like the tax hikes envisioned in the package ill 
support whatever compromise the president makes 
bush had slipped a month earlier by launching his presidential 
campaign with an uncompromising pledge to not raises taxes only to 
subsequently leave the door slightly ajar 
in an oct 15 interview on cable news network bush backtracked 
from the oct 12 houston promise 
what i have said is if i were convinced that all spending 
that could possibly be constrained or cut had taken place then and 
only then would i consider a tax increase he said later the 
same day when pressed for an explanation bush replied im not 
going to raise taxes period 
the dole campaign promises to perform some political truth 
squad work on bushs commercials during the balance of the 
campaign and the bush camp continues to deny that it distorted the 
senators position on taxes 
but with both dole and bush the record is full of 
inconsistencies regarding both general tax increases and the 
question of imposing an import fee on foreign oil 
dole supported the sweeping reduction in tax rates in 1981 but 
helped enact a 983 billion tax hike a year later 
during the 1980 bush labeled as voodoo economics reagans 
pledge to restore us military might while cutting taxes and 
balancing the budget but the record shows no evidence of a bush 
dissent from tax increases that reagan has signed in the ensuing 
years 
the record shows that dole supported various deficitreduction 
tax hike proposals including the 983 billion package a 506 
billion program in 1984 and the 22 billion in hikes contained in a 
plan reagan agreed to last nov 20 in the wake of the wall street 
crash 
bosworth said that in times of general economic prosperity 
candidates for political office score big points by suggesting an 
opponent would raise taxes 
i think dole has probably learned from this loss in new 
hampshire he said it appears republicans voted for bush 
there because he appeared to be more adamant about not raising 
taxes than dole was

senate conferees have stripped lamb import 
quotas and government payments of 365 million to sugar refiners 
from a proposed trade bill that lawmakers want to have ready for 
president reagan by easter 
also abandoned thursday was a move to end favorable tariff 
treatment for romania because of the governments antijewish 
policies critics said foreign policy issues should be kept out of 
trade bills 
removal of those and other politically sensitive provisions 
represented a major step for the 1000page trade bill as lawmakers 
began to make the tough longdelayed decisions needed to get it to 
the presidents desk 
the trimming was done in a response by senate finance committee 
conferees to their counterparts on the house ways and means 
committee the house conferees on tuesday produced a wideranging 
proposal to iron out differences between the two rival versions of 
the bill they have passed 
the lamb provision was the only productspecific quota in the 
legislation sponsored by sen max baucus dmont it would have 
clamped on a quota if imports surged over 110 percent of a formula 
level based on multiyear averages 
the house panel moved earlier to drop the lamb provision which 
was contained only in the senate bill 
the sugar provision would have meant 365 million in payments to 
sugar refining companies mainly to three giants of the industry 
amstar sugar corp imperial sugar co and savannah food and 
industries inc 
under current law companies may obtain refunds known as 
drawbacks on any duties they paid on products they imported as long 
as the products were reexported within five years of the original 
imports 
the provision which was in both versions would have extended 
the rules to enable refiners who claim drawbacks on cane sugar 
imported as early as november 1977 
critics said customs records were lacking and there would be a 
problem with customs fraud proponents said the measure was a 
refund that would cost taxpayers little and help maintain sugar 
industry jobs 
this shows that we want a very positive strong trade bill 
that opens markets but is in no way protectionist senate finance 
committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said thursday 
no fewer than 17 joint committees are negotiating over scores of 
issues contained in the complex bill which has been three years in 
the making it represents a response to huge trade deficits and 
joblessness at home caused by competition from imports 
the measure aims at streamlining the machinery under which the 
united states retaliates against unfair practices by trading 
partners and imposes curbs on imported goods that threaten to 
injure american industry 
among the multitude of issues yet to be resolved is the 
housepassed gephardt amendment which would require 10 percent 
annual rollbacks in excess and unwarranted japanese surpluses 
in trade with this country 
lawmakers are indicating they may wait to tackle that issue 
until after the march 8 super tuesday primaries in which the 
sponsor rep richard gephardt dmo is campaigning for the 
democratic presidential nomination 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski 
dillinois has been saying that gephardt will be among the 
negotiators when a compromise is reached with the senate which did 
not include such a measure in its version 
the senate panels response varied little from what the house 
outlined in its proposal tuesday 
it moved to strike from the bill provisions to step up 
enforcement of customs fraud laws which critics called unworkable 
it went the house one further in eliminating its own proposal to 
give private citizens the right to file lawsuits against unfair 
foreign trade practices 
i am impressed with the senate counteroffer rostenkowski 
said in a statement the house made some painful decisions to 
drop special interest items in favor of a national trade policy 
the senate has upped the ante on that approach

us officials will visit portugal next week 
to talk about giving the portuguese surplus american military 
equipment as a means of offsetting budget cuts in military aid the 
state department says 
gen charles brown chief of the defense security assistance 
agency will head the delegation leaving next monday for portugal 
to talk about what kind of military equipment the united states 
could provide 
the united states has suggested giving portugal surplus 
equipment to make up for budget cuts that have forced a reduction 
in aid below levels promised under a 1983 agreement allowing the 
us military to use bases in portugal 
the announcement thursday came a day after portuguese prime 
minister anibal cavaco silva met with president reagan to complain 
about the lower aid levels and call for a formal review of the 
bases agreement 
portugal wants the military bases to continue cavaco silva 
reiterated in a speech on thursday to the national press club 
and we dont want to reduce the american facilities in portugal 
our decision is a result of difference in interpretation of 
our mutual agreement and we dont want that this point of friction 
will continue until 1991 he said that is the end of this 
agreement 
the agreement an extension of an original pact stemming from 
1951 is out of date cavaco silva said 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said us officials 
were pleased that cavaco silva didnt want a reduction in american 
military presence in portugal unlike the insistence of neigboring 
spanish officials that the united states remove f16s that had been 
based in spain

young families with children have suffered the 
most dramatic income drop since 1970 of any family group in 
america while the elderly have seen the sharpest rise according 
to a new congressional analysis 
the study of family income trends by the congressional budget 
office found that median income for families with children in 
which the head of household was under 25 plummeted 43 percent from 
1970 to 1986 
for those over 65 including people living alone income went up 
more than 50 percent 
a republican senator and a democratic congressman independently 
requested the nonpartisan cbo to do a study of family income 
trends and each offered his own interpretation of the analysis 
released thursday 
sen pete domenici rnm stressed the encouraging cbo finding 
that overall american family income has risen 20 percent since 
1970 rep george miller dcalif pointed to the plight of 
lowincome families with children 
miller also cited cbos finding that many families increased 
their incomes over the 16year period not through higher wages but 
by adding another wageearner to the workforce and with that 
wageearner such added costs as child care and commuting 
in many families both parents must now work to maintain the 
standard of living which results in increased costs as well as 
increased income said miller chairman of the house select 
committee on children youth and families 
cbo said that the elderly as a group were least buffeted by the 
swings of the economy and that rises in their income were due 
primarily to higher social security payments 
among the findings 
while family income for the elderly grew more than 50 percent 
it grew only 26 percent for married couples with children and only 
2 percent for single mothers with children for families head by 
someone under 25 including those without children income dropped 
20 percent 
income fell 13 percent for lowincome single mothers with 
children with 20 percent of such families having less than half 
the cash income needed to live at the poverty level in 1986 
income rose 12 percent to 37 percent for all families with at 
least one fulltime yearround worker for families with children 
and no such worker it fell 10 percent 
domenici senior republican on the senate budget committee and a 
member of the national economic commission said he was not 
surprised by the negative trends among young and singleparent 
families he said any deficitreduction recommendations would be 
screened for their impact on those households 
however domenici said cbo might have found more encouraging 
trends among such families if it had taken into account such 
noncash programs as food stamps and the 1986 tax law that took 
millions of lowincome families off the tax rolls 
cbo said a lack of familylevel data prevented it from including 
noncash programs in its analysis the agency gave similar reasons 
for not taking into account pre1981 tax hikes which reduced 
disposable income and said it was impossible to project the net 
effect of either omission

lawyers for attorney general edwin meese iii 
say he knew nothing about a plan to use pentagon money to give 
israel payments to protect a 1 billion iraqi pipeline project 
the plan was being promoted by meeses longtime friend e 
robert wallach wallachs attorney george g walker confirmed the 
contents of two messages in december 1985 sent by wallach to swiss 
oilman bruce rappaport a partner in the proposed iraqi project 
one contains a reference to meese 
wallach was rappaports attorney 
the washington post which on thursday disclosed the existence 
of the proposal to use pentagon money said the december 1985 
messages plus another wallachtorappaport telex on feb 3 1986 
show that meese supported the plan and that the late william casey 
then cia director endorsed it 
abc news quoting anonymous sources reported that under the 
plan israel would have gotten 400 million in us military aid 
over four years the money was to be set aside in a special bank 
account as construction of the pipeline began the network said 
the attorney general was not involved in any plans to utilize 
defense department funds for the project gave no assurances 
about any such plan and arranged no meeting for that purpose 
said a statement by nathan lewin one of meeses lawyers 
the attorney general has no recollection of anything being 
said to him about any such plan lewin added in an interview 
meeses involvement with the pipeline project is under criminal 
investigation by independent counsel james mckay who is trying to 
determine whether the attorney general may have violated the 
foreign corrupt practices act 
that act makes it illegal for us citizens companies or their 
agents to offer foreign officials anything of value to 
influence them and makes the attorney general responsible for 
filing civil suits to block such payments 
federal investigators also are looking at wallachs failure to 
register as a foreign agent the washington times reported today 
the newspaper quoted justice department officials who were not 
identified as saying the issue could raise conflictofinterest 
problems for meese 
it said that when wallach went to work as a paid lobbyist for 
rappaport he also was acting as an unpaid personal attorney to 
meese during his confirmation hearings as attorney general 
a dec 16 1985 message from wallach to rappaport says that i 
have assurance from my friend that if necessary he will engage new 
person on project wallach usually called meese my friend 
but walker said that rather than being a reference to meese the 
he referred to in that portion of the telex is someone else 
probably national security staff aide david wigg who would explain 
the pipeline project in general terms to the new national security 
adviser john poindexter poindexter had taken over the post from 
robert mcfarlane on dec 4 1985 
walker said that in 1985 nsc aide wigg came up with the idea of 
using pentagon money to make payments to israel to ensure that the 
israelis would not attack the pipeline 
wallach sent a dec 12 1985 telegram to rappaport relating that 
wigg was attempting to determine whether or not pentagon financing 
for the payments could be provided 
wallach said the capital dod department of defense package 
was to be submitted that day by wigg to mcfarlane who was wrapping 
up his government employment 
on dec 16 wallach reported in a message to rappaport that at a 
meeting that day with casey who was a friend of rappaports wigg 
and wallach reviewed documents relating to the pentagon budget plan 
wallach said that casey approved the concept with expression 
as to it being unique in his experience walker said the language 
stops short of saying casey endorses the plan and is simply 
expressing a view about the unique nature of the payment plan 
in a feb 3 1986 message obtained by the post wallach tells 
rappaport meese will contact poindexter to arrange a meeting for 
wallach if it is necessary to obtain signature of his 
poindexters superior 
lewin said meese has no recollection of arranging a meeting for 
wallach with poindexter nor does he recall being asked to do so 
walker said he didnt have a copy of the feb 3 message and that 
wallach didnt remember sending one 
lewins statement said meese stands by a statement he made 
feb 1 that the sum and substance of his involvement with the 
iraqi pipeline project consisted of referring wallach to mcfarlane 
in may 1985 referring thenisraeli prime minister shimon peres to 
mcfarlane in october 1985 and discussing the pipeline briefly with 
peres 
the only other involvement meese said was having the justice 
department office of legal counsel consider a request in october 
1985 on the legality of using us aid money to israel to help 
protect the pipeline from israeli attack 
a sept 25 1985 memo from wallach to meese says that a portion 
of up to 700 million that would go to israel from the pipeline 
would be funneled to the israeli labor party

some 4700 teenagers will be ousted from the 
drivers seats of school buses in north carolina and south carolina 
under a ruling issued by the labor department 
the department in an effort to crack down on enforcement of 
child labor laws announced thursday that 17yearolds must stop 
driving school buses in those states after april 1 said department 
spokesman bob zachariasiewicz 
for the past two decades the department had granted both states 
annual exemptions from the child labor laws that enabled them to 
hire the youths 
the decision to end the exemptions reflected a failure of the 
states to comply with more stringent conditions imposed in december 
on the employment of 17yearolds the department said in a 
statement 
in january a 4yearold west columbia sc boy was run over 
and killed by a 17yearold bus driver who had a previous speeding 
ticket no charges were filed against the driver due to confusion 
over whether he could have seen the child 
deputy secretary of labor dennis whitfield informed the two 
states governors of the decision thursday 
officials from the two states expressed dismay at the ruling 
if this in fact comes to pass it would cause north carolina 
some very big problems and we hope the department of labor will 
send us some bus drivers to go with their order said jim 
sughrue a spokesman for gov jim martin 
south carolina gov carroll campbell said he deeply regrets 
the department of labor has seen fit to withdraw south carolinas 
exemption of 17yearold bus drivers prior to the end of the school 
year 
but the departments findings that certain school districts 
were ignoring its guidelines did not help south carolinas position 
in this matter the governor added 
south carolina has 6000 school bus drivers of whom 1200 are 
17 years old said charlie williams the south carolina 
superintendent of education a total of 1000 young drivers had 
been fired by december because of bad driving records 
north carolina has 13000 drivers of whom 3500 are 17 
zachariasiewicz said in the 198687 school year there were 14350 
drivers of whom 5000 were 16 and 17 years old 
the department banned school bus driving by 16yearolds in 
december he said 
employment of any drivers under 18 after april 1 would result in 
assessment of monetary penalties and possible court action the 
department said 
when the states applied for exemptions for the 198788 school 
year they were instead given extensions until dec 31 1987 while 
they supplied additional data zachariasiewicz said 
in december the department extended the exemptions through the 
198788 school year but three conditions were imposed for the use 
of 17yearold drivers they had to have been trained and started 
driving school buses on or before aug 31 1987 they could not 
have received a ticket for a moving violation or been involved in 
an accident for which they were responsible in a car or a bus 
during the 198687 school year and they had to be students or high 
school graduates 
investigations by the department of how the states followed 
these criteria revealed widespread noncompliance particularly 
employment of 17yearolds with moving violations on their driving 
records as student school bus drivers the department statement 
said 
in south carolina in 14 of 15 school districts investigated 
the department found approximately 200 instances of 
noncompliance the statement said 
north carolina had received exemptions since 1967 while south 
carolina had received them since 1968

the reagan administration is welcoming reports 
from moscow that a strategic arms agreement could be ready for 
signing at a may summit but says it is doubtful such a timetable 
could be met 
we welcome it if it means the soviets are going to work at 
the negotiations just as hard as we will an administration 
official said thursday speaking on condition of anonymity 
and reagan in an interview thursday with the washington post 
expressed hope it could be signed by the end of the year although 
the time is too limited to complete work on the treaty by the 
summit 
a senior soviet official in moscow also said thursday he 
expected a treaty to reduce the superpowers longrange nuclear 
weapons stockpile would be ready for signing at the summit meeting 
the post said 
the official who was not identified talked to about 20 foreign 
reporters at a twohour meeting the post was uninvited but said it 
obtained its account from other reporters 
the official also said that reagan will stay in the kremlin 
during the visit which should last for about a week and could 
include other cities besides moscow according to the account in 
todays post 
the administration is known to completely discount the 
speculation that reagan would stay in the kremlin 
according to administration officials reagans expected trip to 
moscow is likely to mirror in length and style the fourday visit 
to washington last december by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the officials said thursday that no dates have been fixed for 
the presidents trip but that tentative plans continue to be that 
it will fall sometime from mid to latemay to early june 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters this week 
he did not expect a summit date to be set until soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze meets in washington late next month 
with secretary of state george shultz who just returned from 
moscow 
gorbachevs visit was confined to washington in a strict 
observance of the rule of reciprocity reagan is expected to remain 
in moscow 
the new york times in an account of the briefing published in 
todays editions said the official indicated the soviet union 
might drop a key objection to the us development of a spacebased 
missile defense system by permitting the testing of components in 
space

the discovery of a synthetic peptide that 
triggers antibodies to neutralize the aids virus in rabbits may 
eventually help in combating the fatal disease in humans a chicago 
researcher says 
mark gurney an assistant professor at the university of 
chicago said thursday that the peptides he synthesized imitate 
part of the hiv virus the hiv is the virus that causes aids or 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the potential is that you could use a peptide to elicit 
the same type of antibodies in man and these would then attack the 
virus gurney said 
peptides are compounds of amino acids and the ones that gurney 
made were identical in some ways to a portion of the envelope that 
surrounds the human immune virus 
in the experiments researchers put the peptides into laboratory 
rabbits the immune system of the rabbits produced three antibodies 
against the peptides 
researchers then exposed these antibodies to several strains of 
the hiv virus in test tubes and gurney said the hiv virus was 
neutralized or prevented from spreading to other cells 
the experiment used a peptide that was a chemical mimic of a 
portion of the hiv envelope that remains unchanged gurney said 
other parts of the virus change frequently 
this unchanging portion of the hiv virus does not elicit an 
antibody response when it is attached to the whole virus for 
reasons that scientists do not understand said gurney 
he said peptideantibody response is not well understood now and 
that experiments in the past have shown that synthetic peptides can 
trigger undesirable antibodies only a small number of which will 
attack the target 
until this process is further refined he said peptides will 
not be useful against aids 
he said the researchers also are unable to determine precisely 
how the antibodies created by using the peptide are able to 
neutralize aids in the test tube 
gurney worked on the experiment with david d ho of the 
cedarssinai medical center in los angeles joan c kaplan of 
massachusetts general hospital in boston and indre e rackauskas 
of the university of chicago 
a report on the research appears today in science the journal 
of the american association for the advancement of science 
aids kills by destroying a key part of the human immune system 
leaving the body open to infections aids is spread principally 
through sexual contact but also by the shared needles of drug 
abusers and the use of contaminated blood products in transfusions 
infected mothers may also pass the aids virus to their babies while 
giving birth 
as of feb 15 aids had been diagnosed in 53814 americans of 
whom more than half or 30158 have died since 1981 according to 
the federal centers for disease control no one is known to have 
recovered from aids

although he will have all the functions of president under 
panamas constitution solis palma 71 will have the title minister 
in charge of the presidency of the republic rather than president 
he will fill out the current presidential term which ends in 
october 1989 elections are scheduled for may 1989 
according to the constitution selection of a new chief 
executive goes to the cabinet and the title is changed because the 
country no longer has a vice president 
delvalle was first elected vice president on a ticket with 
president nicolas ardito barletta and assumed the presidency when 
ardito barletta stepped down after 11 months in power 
panama has been rocked by protests since june when noriegas 
recently retired second in command publicly charged the general 
with illicit activities ranging from drug trafficking to electoral 
fraud and the assassination of a political opponent 
a flight of money from panama followed 
today the country is virtually at siege economically by 
external pressures and tensions delvalle told the nation 
thursday i have to consider with sadness that many of the 
successes that had been obtained are vanishing in the past eight 
months 
the defense forces have about 15000 soldiers and police under 
their command in this nation of 22 million people 
relations between the united states and panama have deteriorated 
since the antinoriega demonstrations broke out last summer 
noriega has demanded removal of the southern command which the 
pentagon and the white house have rejected saying american troops 
are legally in panama and will remain there to protect the canal 
until it is handed over to panama on dec 31 1999 
noriega later said he was referring only to the headquarters 
unit responsible for us strategic military planning american 
military sources said that would involve the removal of only about 
300 officers and men 
during his birthday speech this month noriega received an 
ovation when he declared if they want me out theyll have to 
kill me 
the reagan administration looks upon noriega as the main 
obstacle in its goal of an eventual transition in panama to a truly 
civilian government 
delvalle assumed the presidency in 1985 under circumstances 
which strongly suggested that noriega forced the ouster of 
delvalles predecessor 
it was a constitutional succession but delvalle has been widely 
perceived as no more than panamas titular head 
noriega has maintained that executive authority rests with 
delvalle and that panama has achieved a full transition to 
democracy he says his us critics are campaigning against him 
with the aim of annulling the panama canal treaties under which 
the waterway reverts to panamanian control 
us officials said wednesday that delvalles extensive business 
interests and family could be threatened if he were to break with 
noriega in addition delvalles health is said to be tenuous 
because of a heart operation 
however they said delvalle was increasingly disturbed by his 
ties to noriega 
noriega entered the panamanian national guard in 1962 as a 
lieutenant after attending a military college in peru on a 
scholarship he quickly became acquainted with a rising young 
officer named omar torrijos 
torrijos took power in panama in a 1968 coup less than a year 
later he named noriega then an obscure major in northernmost 
panama as his chief of intelligence with the rank of lieutenant 
colonel 
the job put noriega in touch with us intelligence agencies 
concerned over any potential threats to the panama canal 
when torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981 
noriega began shouldering his way to the top command he took power 
in 1983 
on an official salary of 60000 a year noriega lives in a 
twostory colonialstyle mansion in an exclusive district of 
panama city and maintains a fleet of expensive cars he is reported 
to own at least a dozen properties including an apartment in paris 
and a chateau in the south of france

actor jimmy stewart drew cheers and tears at a 
ceremony honoring him for what first lady nancy reagan described as 
his wonderful life 
your own story could be an entire museum mrs reagan told 
stewart and about 1000 stewart fans at the thursday night ceremony 
sponsored by the american museum of the moving image the nations 
first largescale film and television museum scheduled to open 
here in may 
the first lady also revealed that she developed a crush on 
stewart after he visited her family in california and entertained 
them with his guitar 
in my teenage years i had a huge crush on jimmy she said 
for a 16yearold to have jimmy stewart for a weekend was too 
much i was overcome i was gone you know that crush has grown 
into a real love 
i have a twinge of jealousy for those who had the honor to 
perform with him the former actress added 
colleagues such as kirk douglas richard dreyfuss brooke 
shields and janet leigh spoke about how stewart had become as much 
a source of inspiration as his movies which include its a 
wonderful life the spirit of st louis and mr smith goes 
to washington 
i doubt you know who you really and truly are mr stewart 
dreyfuss said you have taught and trained me as an actor you 
have inspired me as a storyteller and you have come to personify a 
part of this nation to symbolize the american man who is gentle 
ironic selfdepreciating tough and emotional 
douglas drew chuckles from the audience at the waldorfastoria 
hotel ballroom when he said he was in awe of the 79yearold man 
who has been an inspiration to all of us young actors 
stewart spoke briefly praising the museum 
im really astounded at what all of you have done here to 
create and bring to reality all you have done in the american 
museum of the moving image said stewart whose wife gloria and 
two daughters also attended 
the 114 million museum will feature exhibits that explore the 
art history and technology of all moving image media 
the most moving part of the evening occurred when the audience 
was shown a segment from the tonight show in which stewart read 
a poem about his dog bo 
although the poem began with comical recollections of the dog 
it ended with a tearful stewart describing how the dog died and how 
he missed having it beside him 
miss shields who was choked up as she started to speak after 
watching the film clip from the podium told the audience she too 
had a dog named bo

education minister manuel solis palma 
was sworn in as panamas new chief of state early friday to replace 
president eric arturo delvalle removed from office after he 
ordered the countrys military strongman to step down 
legislative assembly president alberto aleman boyd administered 
the oath of office to palma solis at the assembly building shortly 
before 4 am est 
delvalle said he rejected his removal which came after the 
military challenged his order dismissing noriega and the man named 
as new chief of the defense forces refused to take the job 
noriega who is under us indictment as a drug trafficker is 
regarded as the real power behind the civilian government in 
panama headquarters for us military operations in latin america 
opposition lawmakers did not attend the 10minute emergency 
legislative session during which delvalle and vice president 
roderick esquivel were removed from office the actions were by 
unanimous vote of the 38 members of the 67seat assembly in 
attendance 
the cabinet which delvalle said he fired today then named 
solis palma chief of state to complete delvalles term elections 
are scheduled for may 1989 
at his home delvalle said he fired all 12 cabinet members and 
called the resolution something legally despicable that only 
fulfills a formality in the mind of those who want to grasp power 
at any cost 
they will not receive acceptance from any country that takes 
pride in being democratic delvalle said 
in washington white house spokesman bob hall said the white 
house would have no comment until morning an official at the state 
department also had no immediate comment 
the national democratic union which backs the military holds 
45 seats in the assembly the rest are held by the democratic 
alliance of the opposition none of whose members attended the 
session 
in its resolution the assembly said delvalle did not follow 
constitutional procedures and laws of the defense forces in 
removing noriega 
in addition it said in announcing his decision delvalle 
mentioned the us charges against noriega showing that this 
conduct of the president occurs with the object of permitting the 
intervention of the government of the united states in the internal 
affairs of panama 
it said delvalles action damaged national sovereignty and 
endangered the peace and security of the country also violating 
the constitution 
it said esquivel had abandoned his post sept 8 1987 in 
violation of the constitution 
there was no immediate comment from noriega who has said he is 
innocent of all charges against him 
delvalle said earlier that col marcos justines the chief of 
staff would replace noriega as head of the defense forces 
thursday night justines said i reject that order 
the police chief for the defense forces flanked by colonels and 
lieutenant colonels at the forces central garrison told 
panamanian tv no officer would replace noriega 
he delvalle is going first col leonidas macias said 
none of us wants the panamanian military command the 
commander stays and we all stay the president goes 
justines also at the garrison told television reporters we 
have been conversing with him delvalle constantly and he knows 
that our position has been that there is too much american 
interference in this panamanian affair 
we are not here denying or refusing this post because its not 
our place because we have a commander commander noriega 
justines added 
the governments radio nacional called panamanians to a thursday 
night rally supporting noriega at a downtown park near the national 
palace but apparently few people responded downtown streets were 
nearly empty 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had issued a statement in 
washington thursday sayingwe understand that president delvalle 
today dismissed gen noriega from his position as commander of the 
panama defense forces 
at this time we want to reiterate our unqualified support for 
civilian constitutional rule in panama 
washington called for noriegas resignation after us grand 
juries in miami and tampa fla indicted him and others on drug 
trafficking charges feb 5 
the indictments accuse noriega of using his military position to 
let colombian drug traffickers use panama as a base for smuggling 
cocaine and marijuana into the united states the charges said 
noriega received a healthy kickback from drug profits 
the military command late thursday ordered closure of channel 5 
television station owned by delvalle said an employee who spoke 
on condition of anonymity for security reasons 
the opposition daily la prensa also was closed by military 
order according to its news editor alfredo jimenez he said an 
army officer arrived at the newspaper offices at 730 pm and 
told me we had 10 minutes to vacate the building 
pentagon spokeswoman capt nancy laluntas said in washington 
that the us southern command in panama received reports of 
scattered demonstrations in and around panama city she said the 
command issued a bravo alert which orders american military 
personnel and dependents to decrease their visibility 
the command initially created to protect the panama canal has 
become the center for us military operations in latin america 
from fighting rebels to drug smugglers there are 10000 us 
soldiers and 20000 dependents here 
delvalle said in a nationally broadcast message thursday that he 
asked noriega days ago to step down voluntarily so an investigation 
could begin of charges that he engaged in illicit activities he 
said noriega refused 
the president said there is no other alternative but the use 
of the powers that the constitution gives me to separate gen 
noriega from his high command and to encharge the leadership of the 
institution to the current chief of staff col marcos justines 
some drivers honked their horns shortly after delvalle made his 
announcement and some groups could be seen waving white 
handkerchiefs both are signs of protest used by noriegas 
opponents 
later at his home delvalle told the associated press i am 
very calm because i have had to take a very difficult decision 
having to do with a person noriega with whom i have worked for 
nearly two years with a great deal of respect and consideration 
however his little will to take that decision which i 
suggested to him obligated me to take it for the health of this 
country 
about 10 antiriot police then arrived and remained on guard 
in the evening about 100 people relatives friends and 
journalists gathered at delvalles home 
earlier thursday roman catholic archbishop marcos gregorio 
mcgrath visited delvalle and commented it seems to us that we 
should give our support to president delvalle it is a step taken 
after many consultations 
delvalle smiled when reporters asked if he feared the military 
would remove him from office if good judgment doesnt prevail 
no president has the force to defy the arms that we entrusted 
to them so that they might take care of us he replied 
us ambassador arthur davis showed up for a few minutes my 
presence here is to show my support to the government because we 
always have supported the civilian government and we are going to 
continue doing so he said 
asked if the us government would recognize a replacement for 
delvalle davis replied we cannot do that 
panama has a0878

panamas president risked challenging the authority 
of gen manuel antonio noriega because he heard the outcry of the 
people against the military strongman says a leading panamanian 
exile 
the central american nations legislative assembly removed 
president eric arturo delvalle and the vice president from office 
during an emergency session early today 
roberto eisenmann 50yearold exiled publisher of panamas 
leading independent newspaper la prensa said earlier that either 
way the power struggle went noriega will lose 
i dont think he will find any nation that would recognize his 
government in the event of a coup said eisenmann who said his 
newspaper was shut down thursday by the military 
delvalles decision to challenge noriega was made after seven 
weeks of negotiations here between the president and half a dozen 
opposition leaders participants in the talks told the miami herald 
in a story published today 
the last stage leading to the decision began in early january 
when the thenpanamanian consul to new york jose blandon met with 
several opposition leaders in the home of former panamanian 
ambassador and antinoriega crusader gabriel lewis galindo in the 
miami suburb of kendall 
blandon had just spent 10 hours with delvalle in new york 
ricardo arias calderon president of the christian democratic 
party told the herald he told us the president was ready to 
oust noriega but that he wanted to do that as of aug 12 
that date marked the fifth anniversary of noriegas rise to the 
helm of panamas defense forces 
but the opposition politicians told delvalle that if noriega was 
given that much time he would be able to regroup 
on feb 16 the opposition counseled the president to go to 
washington convene an emergency session of the organization of 
american states and announce noriegas dismissal the herald 
reported 
a week ago wednesday delvalle met with us assistant secretary 
of state elliott abrams whom he informed he would fire noriega 
but in panama not in the united states 
the thing that worked on him was the enormous outcry of the 
people eisenmann told abcs nightline thursday night 
there was pressure from his family not to go down the tubes with 
noriega 
noriega was indicted three weeks ago in tampa and miami on 
federal charges of aiding drug smugglers and has been under 
pressure to step down as military chief 
gilbert mallol who directs the national civic crusade a 
panamanian opposition coalition of 192 organizations predicted 
thursday during a visit to miami that delvalles move would force 
noriega into seizing power and remove the facade of democracy 
mallol a 32yearold engineer lived here in exile after 
eluding military police and fleeing panama last summer his group 
was accused last august of plotting against noriega but mallol 
recently had returned to panama 
a prosecutor in noriegas drug case said he knew of no us deal 
to drop charges in order to encourage delvalle to challenge the 
military leader 
richard gregorie chief assistant us attorney in floridas 
southern district said if noriega were to leave panama we would 
attempt to extradite him like any other dope dealer 
the feb 4 indictments charge noriega and 15 others with taking 
at least 46 million in payoffs to protect shipments of colombian 
cocaine launder money supply drug laboratories and shield drug 
kingpins 
the indictment also alleged that noriega was allied with the 
medellin cartel the organization reputed to supply much of the 
cocaine in the united states and once enlisted the help of cuban 
leader fidel castro to mediate a dispute with the cartel over drug 
money 
castro who was named in the indictment but not charged angrily 
denied the any role in an interview with nbc news aired thursday 
night 
if noriega is ever brought to trial and convicted of all 
charges he could face up to 145 years in prison and fines of more 
than 11 million

cardinal miguel obando y bravo has 
proposed that a new round of peace talks between the leftist 
sandinista government and contra rebels be held in guatemala march 
1012 
the roman catholic archbishop of managua who is mediating 
efforts to establish a ceasefire suggested the dates thursday in 
response to a letter from president daniel ortega 
he made no reference to ortegas request for three days of 
negotiations beginning today and did not explain why he was 
suggesting different dates 
obando y bravo suspended the last round of negotiations feb 18 
in guatemala after presenting a proposal for breaking a deadlock 
that arose in the talks first hours 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco accused the cardinal 
nicaraguas catholic leader of breaking off the talks before the 
government could deliver its formal conditional acceptance of the 
proposal 
in his letter obando y bravo asked ortega if the presidents 
letter of tuesday was a rejection of the acceptance in principle 
that your delegation belatedly gave to the proposal 
there was no immediate response from the government to the march 
dates or obando y bravos letter 
the cardinal said representatives of the nicaraguan resistance 
the umbrella group for the rebels told him thursday they are 
willing to continue discussing the proposal the mediator made feb 
18 in guatemala 
the proposal asks the contras to accept a 30day truce in 
exchange for four concessions they have long sought from the 
government changes in the draft law a complete amnesty an 
easing of press restrictions and a reopening of talks with the 
internal political opposition 
the ceasefire effort is part of a regional peace plan signed 
aug 7 in guatemala by nicaragua el salvador honduras guatemala 
and costa rica it also calls for amnesties democratic reforms and 
an end to outside aid to insurgencies fighting in the region 
the reagan administration has supported the contras 6yearold 
insurgency which has claimed about 40000 lives but on feb 3 
the us house of representatives turned down a request for an 
additional 362 million in contra aid

reading of 69 on the richter scale the observatory said 
the epicenter was about 1110 miles eastsoutheast of the south 
african port city of durban it said the observatory said it had 
received no reports of tsunamis or huge waves generated by 
earthquakes at sea 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
an earthquake registering 7 is capable of widespread heavy

a 98yearold oklahoma law stating that a 
husband is head of the household and his wife must live where he 
does is headed toward repeal in the state legislature but not 
without debate 
the bill to change the 1890 law was approved by the house 6726 
thursday and moves to the senate 
i want to bring oklahoma from the 19th century into the 20th 
century before the 21st century gets here said the bills 
sponsor rep freddie williams 
if the law were enforced mrs williams said an appeals court 
judge would have to step down from the bench because she lives on 
one side of the state and and her husband lives on the other 
even so opponents of repeal heatedly argued that the law is 
based on biblical teachings about the family 
i think there should be a difference between a man and a 
woman and when we get to where theres not a difference in it 
were going to have all kinds of problems whether its war or what 
it is said rep bill smith 
rep leonard sullivan contended he had never heard any lady 
call for repeal of the law 
if its not broke dont fix it sullivan said and if 
its not being enforced why worry 
rep ken harris a supporter of the bill said even having to 
argue about this bill is a sad sad commentary 
mrs williams and harris pointed out that the law had been 
declared unconstitutional by a former attorney general 
rep john monks said the attorney general who made the ruling 
never married and never had the responsibility for a family

she soared west across the atlantic on a 
celebrated dare 52 years ago and then fell into obscurity 
but decades after flier beryl markham was forgotten hollywood 
is showing a renewed interest in the heroine several movies of her 
wildly adventurous life are underway or planned including a 
fourhour cbstv special starring stefanie powers and at least two 
featurelength films 
in 1986 public television presented the film world without 
walls beryl markhams african memoir shortly after her death at 
the age of 83 the movie reconstructed her life from old film 
footage and interviews with her gossipy contemporaries in kenya 
where she once hunted barefoot with african friends 
she represented some kind of magicallike past something that 
a woman did but that cant ever be done again because the world in 
which that took place is gone said george gutekunst who 
rediscovered markhams memoirs west with the night and helped 
get them republished in 1983 
the book chronicled her kenyan childhood and historic flight 
praised by ernest hemingway as bloody wonderful it became a 
best seller in both britain and the united states when it was 
republished shes caught the imagination of much of this country 
and the world since then gutekunst said 
gutekunst met markham in kenya before her death with his 
partner albert del masso he later secured movie rights to the 
book 
in some cities such as san francisco fascination with markham 
approaches cult status according to berniece green a new york 
publicist for cbs which in january began filming in africa on 
beryl markham shadow on the sun 
markham was born in melton mowbray leicestershire in england 
and was brought to kenya at age 4 by her divorced father retired

she had less than four years of formal education but said her 
father made her read widely later she was given a crash course in 
literature and music by an oxfordeducated aristocrat and 
professional hunter denys finchhatton the lover of the danish 
writer karen blixen whose pen name was isak dinesen the academy 
awardwinning movie out of africa was based on blixens life 
markham was apparently finchhattons last love 
markhams poetic account of her childhood and famed flight was 
largely ignored when first published in 1942 but following its 
rerelease and then her death the books sales soared it has been 
on the new york times bestsellers list since november 1986 
according to north point press 
in 1936 markham became the first person to fly solo 
easttowest across the atlantic accepting a challenge from 
englands lord john carberry she had grown up in kenya with masai 
children become a winning horse trainer and also one of the 
continents premier bush pilots 
kenya in the 1920s and 30s was a haven for titled europeans 
and markham who spent much of her youth hunting wild boar and 
fending off lions lived with them she took up thoroughbred 
training to support herself at 17 when her bankrupt father 
immigrated to peru 
cbs story based on english journalist james foxs book 
white mischief will portray markhams three failed marriages 
affairs with fliers finchhatton and tom campbell black and her 
years in santa barbara where she taught flying for paramount

home in england

markham lovell found the flier in 1985 living in a tiny house 
outside nairobi at a track where she had trained some of kenyas

as a lawyer and vice president of wc fields 
productions everett f fields has sound economic reasons to be 
worried about products that make unauthorized use of wc fields 
name and image 
as a grandson he told state legislators thursday he finds the 
merchandising of wc fields legacy to be very offensive 
personally 
fields joined the sons of clark gable and john wayne in 
supporting a bill that would give them exclusive rights to the 
commercial use of their dead relatives names 
i think that my fathers public image was his most valuable 
asset said michael wayne son of the screen star and president 
of john wayne enterprises the most important thing for us the 
wayne family is to control how the john wayne image is used 
john clark gable a 26yearold pickuptruck racer from los 
angeles became angry as he cited a greeting card that depicted his 
late father in an embrace with another man 
the guy that created that id like to tear his head off 
gable said following his appearance at the legislative hearing 
other examples that were cited at the hearing included a spanish 
cigarette billboard showing wayne a heavy smoker who died of lung 
cancer smoking a cigarette albert einstein party favors a 
sigmund freud cookbook and dead marilyn a male rock singer 
who dresses to resemble marilyn monroe 
the bill being considered would ban any unauthorized commercial 
use of the name or image of dead celebrities but wouldnt prohibit 
accurate biographies news accounts or parodies of stars 
proponents said it would simply give heirs the same protection that 
celebrities enjoy while they are alive 
the measure was opposed by representatives of magazine and 
newspaper publishers television and radio stations and advertising 
agencies the opponents said the measure is unnecessary and it 
would be difficult to determine which uses of a celebritys name 
were legitimate 
the problem is the cure is worse than the disease said 
richard winfield a lawyer for time inc 
jerome wilson another attorney representing time suggested 
that the heirs of al capone would be able to sue for some of the 
proceeds of the untouchables the movie in which capone was a 
major figure 
similar laws have been enacted in eight states including 
california and have been established by precedent in two others 
new jersey and georgia according to j thomas mccarthy a law 
professor from the university of san francisco who testified at the 
hearing 
mccarthy said there have been no challenges to the 
constitutionality of the other states laws although he said there 
have been some successful challenges to specific applications of 
the laws

southern city of kwangju and police said radical students planted 
the device 
the bomb was found in the public library of the us information 
service and people in the building were evacuated while army bomb 
experts were brought in to defuse the device us diplomats said

announcing the measure 
the political and labor cases were included in an amnesty for 
7234 people most of them convicted of ordinary criminal offenses

still in prison but it appeared many have been released in earlier 
amnesties those still in prison were to be freed saturday 
but several imprisoned prominent dissident leaders including 
kim kuntae and chang kipyo were not to be released because of 
their role in violent protests according to korean news reports

political offenses

political charges 
the measure restores the civil rights of many prominent

roh won the election with 366 percent of the vote after the two 
kims split the opposition vote 
the opposition claimed after the dec 16 election that roh had 
won through massive vote fraud and said they would not recognize

blaming the two kims for splitting opposition support out of 
personal ambition

case to remove the governor from office 
attorney william french said he didnt expect to be teamed with 
another lawyer particularly one hed never worked with when house 
speaker joe lane a republican hired him in october to look into 
allegations against mecham also a republican 
french 56 was joined by cocounsel paul eckstein 47 after 
house minority leader art hamilton insisted that french could not 
be expected to represent democratic interests because he was hired 
by the republicans 
french a former us justice department attorney and maricopa 
county superior court judge has also been accused of bias because 
he is a registered democrat who signed a mecham recall petition he 
maintains he is largely apolitical 
eckstein is managing partner of a law firm that represents 
arizonas first amendment coalition a journalism rights advocacy 
organization until recently he chaired democrat carolyn warners 
campaign against mecham in the may 17 recall election 
the two men who took the arizona bar exam at the same time in 
1965 say they will draw on each others strengths and rely on 
methodical hard work to prepare for arizonas first gubernatorial 
impeachment trial monday 
mecham was accused by the house of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund 
by lending it to his auto dealership and trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official 
mecham also faces a march 22 criminal trial on charges of hiding 
the 350000 loan he has denied any wrongdoing 
french said he and eckstein have had no major conflicts 
i think we sort of sized each other up to see if we were going 
to play it straight french said and within a matter of hours 
i was satisfied that the politics had been left outside of the 
door 
their courtroom manner french precise of speech both in word 
selection and in timing for dramatic impact and eckstein typically 
dry as he worked in frenchs shadow has contrasted sharply with 
the combative theatrical style often shown by mecham attorney 
murray miller 
but lane noted we have not seen them under any stress 
situations its going to be interesting when it gets really hot 
during the senate trial 
both lawyers say they are ready to start the trial and figure 
theyre as wellequipped to handle it as anyone would be there 
arent any impeachment lawyers around eckstein said 
he said he probably will defer to french on some matters because 
his elder partner was on the case first 
french does bring the experience of a judge but has a 
relative lack of experience in politics and dealing with the media 
eckstein said 
despite the political nature of the trial eckstein added 
its just practicing the law in a careful workmanlike way 
were trying to try it as if you would try it in the 
courthouse french said he said the lawyers have had no contact 
with the 30 senators who essentially are serving as judges and 
jurors in the case 
french has been receiving state police protection since his law 
office was damaged in an arson fire a week before he made the 
report that led to mechams impeachment 
mecham was impeached feb 5 on a 4616 house vote forcing him 
to temporarily hand over power to secretary of state rose mofford 
a democrat a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is required 
to remove him from office permanently

a construction worker who underwent a 
rare procedure in which his severed hand was attached to his 
abdomen until doctors could sew it back on his arm says the 
technique might help other people even if it doesnt work for him 
after mike thomas left hand was ripped off when he grabbed a 
cable in a 70foot fall from a girder last november doctors used a 
vein from his leg to attach the hand to an artery in his abdomen to 
try to keep the tissue alive 
two weeks ago they put the hand back on his arm 
if it doesnt work at least they know they can put a hand on 
an abdomen and maybe use the procedure to help someone else 
thomas 31 said thursday before leaving university hospital for 
his home in cleveland ala 
the procedure has been done twice before in yugoslavia once 
successfully hospital spokesman hank black said doctors at the 
hospital knew of no other such procedure in this country 
thomas doctors said it will be months before he knows whether 
he has any feeling in the hand but the worker said that was not 
what mattered 
the hand was a minor detail when i first fell because i was 
worried about living said thomas who suffered internal injuries 
in the fall 
i have no feeling in the hand now but the blood supply is 
fine he said it will be six months to a year before i know 
whether i have any feeling 
thomas said he became accustomed to the hand not being there 
and now ive got to get used to it being back 
in reattaching the hand the doctors connected two nerves with 
another operation needed to restore a third nerve 
one of the physicians paul sauer said a therapist will work on 
the hand twice a week for a few months 
i have to keep the hand exercised thomas said and 
protect my arm like it was a child his bandaged hand is in a 
sling 
he said one of his first priorities was to get some barbecue 
later he said he wants his doctors to visit blount county so he 
can introduce them to farm life and take them bass fishing 
another doctor michael chernofsky said that thomas and his 
wife loretta had maintained a positive attitude and a sense of 
humor 
he is very lucky to be alive chernofsky said the hand is 
icing on the cake he has done extremely well and were hopeful 
things will continue in that trend 
we have great hopes for mr thomas he promised to take us 
fishing

it said longrange g5 artillery pieces also were used to shell 
angolan army positions around cuito cuanavale a strategic garrison

a researcher who conducted some of the 
earliest studies linking cigarettes to cancer was muffled by his 
superiors about the time a tobacco company began making donations 
to his institute according to a confidential document released in 
a cigarette liability trial 
in the document a top philip morris co executive also praised 
the director of the sloankettering institute a leading medical 
research center for expressing his doubt that smoking is 
implicated in causing cancer 
the opinion of the director dr frank horsfall jr was 
beneficial to the industry according to the nov 23 1964 
memo which was released thursday in federal court here 
morris decided to contribute 25000 to the new york cancer 
research institute nov 8 1962 and made 25000 donations the 
following two years according to the memo written by james c 
bowling who was identified in court as an assistant to the 
companys chairman 
substantial contributions from five other tobacco companies 
followed the memo said 
in the fall of 1962 horsfall and other institute officials 
began subjecting the researcher ernst wynder to a more rigorous 
screening procedure before letting him speak in the name of the 
institute the memo said 
this has had a proper and pleasing effect bowlings memo 
said 
wynder one of the first researchers to demonstrate that smoking 
leads to tumors on mice was a leading antismoking advocate the 
memo said 
the memo did not say that horsfalls attitude or wynders 
screening was a reason for the contributions 
marc z edell an attorney representing antonio cipollone 
introduced the document and about a dozen others in an attempt to 
show that tobacco companies treated early studies of smokings 
effect on health as a public relations problem 
in addition edell said the companies performed or sponsored 
research to deflect charges that smoking caused cancer and other 
health problems 
edell maintains that philip morris co lorillard inc and 
liggett group inc were liable for the death of cipollones wife 
rose cipollone smoked brands made by the three companies for 40 
years before she died at 58 in 1984 
edell contends the companies were liable for her disease by 
failing to do enough research tell customers what they knew or put 
a safer product on the market 
he introduced the documents thursday while questioning morris 
former president and chairman emeritus joseph f cullman iii for a 
third day 
the tobacco industry viewed itself as waging war against 
opponents of smoking who linked cigarettes to health hazards in the 
1960s according to another document 
that feb 12 1963 memo from the scientific director of a 
tobacco research group to a public relations official spoke of 
two fronts in our war 
the memo identified those fronts as activity by the american 
cancer society and britains royal college of physicians and a 
study by the surgeon general edell said 
both the american cancer society and the royal college of 
physicians were concerned about the health effects of smoking and 
the surgeon general published a report citing the dangers of 
cigarettes in 1964

made his name in chicago in the 1930s

a widely used pair of antibiotics prevented a 
deadly form of pneumonia in a group of 30 aids patients while more 
than half of the patients in a similar untreated group came down 
with it researchers reported today 
this dramatic success in preventing one of the leading causes of 
death among aids patients is not a cure for acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome but could prolong the lives of aids sufferers 
said the studys principal author dr margaret fischl of the 
university of miami school of medicine 
any individual that is symptomatic with hiv the aids virus 
should be considered for intervention with lowdose antibiotics to 
prevent pneumocystis said fischl its easily available its 
not expensive 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia strikes more than half of aids 
patients and 15 percent to 25 percent of individuals will die 
with it even when its recognized and treated she said 
in a separate development the antiaids drug azt was shown to 
lower virus levels and improve immune systems in more than 
twothirds of 18 otherwise healthy aids carriers according to a 
study done at the university of amsterdam the netherlands 
and a university of chicago researcher announced that he had 
synthesized a peptide a compound of amino acids that imitates 
part of the aids virus and triggered antibodies to neutralize the 
virus in rabbits 
fischl prevented pneumocystis with a pair of sulfa drugs called 
trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole marketed under a variety of 
trade names including bactrim and septra they are used for kidney 
infections bladder infections travelers diarrhea and at high 
doses for treatment of pneumocystis in aids victims she said 
after three years pneumocystis had not struck any of the 
treated group of 30 patients who had kaposis sarcoma a skin 
cancer but had not had any of the socalled opportunistic 
infections including pneumocystis that strike aids patients 
fischl reported 
in a control group of 30 untreated aids patients 16 got 
pneumocystis she said a report of the findings appears today in 
the journal of the american medical association 
when the experiment concluded 42 percent of the treated group 
was still alive compared with only 10 percent of the untreated 
group fischl said 
that was clear evidence that the preventive treatment was 
prolonging lives but exactly how long it might prolong life could 
not be determined she said 
half of the treated patients suffered from side effects 
including nausea vomiting itching redness of the skin and fever 
the results of the dutch study on azt reported in the feb 20 
issue of the lancet a british medical journal were described as 
promising but they fall short of what doctors would need to 
recommend that healthy aids virus carriers begin taking azt to 
prevent aids dr samuel broder the director of aids drug testing 
at the national cancer institute said thursday 
nevertheless broder said it suggests that a recently initiated 
american study of azt in healthy carriers needs to proceed 
urgently 
its very important not to rush out and start using azt in a 
situation in which its use has not been proven broder said he 
noted that azt can have lifethreatening side effects 
the study found that levels of the aids virus declined 
significantly in 13 of 18 men who had longstanding aids virus 
infections but no symptoms of aids 
levels of white blood cells called t4 cells which are a 
necessary component of the immune system and are killed by the aids 
virus rose in 14 of the 18 subjects no serious side effects were 
observed said the studys authors frank de wolf jan van der 
noordaa and others from the university of amsterdam the 
netherlands 
the aim of such studies is ultimately to determine whether azt 
might prevent or delay the development of aids in healthy carriers 
or reduce its severity 
based on their results the dutch team said prevention of more 
serious hivrelated disease may be feasible hiv or human 
immunodeficiency virus is the virus responsible for aids 
enlarged lymph nodes are a common sign of aids infection the 
researchers reported striking regression of lymph node sizes in 
patients given azt also known as zidovudine or retrovir 
as of feb 18 1158 subjects had been enrolled in a nationwide 
trial of azt in healthy aids carriers in the united states said 
sandra hecker spokeswoman for the national institute of allergy 
and infectious diseases in bethesda md which is coordinating the 
trial 
the study is aiming for about 1500 volunteers and is expected 
to last about three years she said 
in the research by university of chicago assistant professor 
mark gurney rabbits given the synthetic peptide produced three 
antibodies against the compound scientists then exposed these 
antibodies to several strains of the hiv virus in test tubes and 
gurney said the hiv virus was neutralized or prevented from 
spreading to other cells 
a report on the research appeared today in science the journal 
of the american association for the advancement of science 
gurney cautioned that the peptideantibody response is not well 
understood now and that experiments in the past have shown that 
synthetic peptides can trigger undesirable antibodies only a small 
number of which will attack the target 
until this process is further refined he said peptides will 
not be useful against aids

demonstrators continued to occupy the 
university of dayton presidents office early today demanding an 
end to central intelligence agency recruiting on campus 
brother raymond l fitz president of the roman catholic school 
met with members of the democratic socialists of america and 
plowshares for peace in the office for about 90 minutes during the 
night to hear their demands 
about 50 members of the groups took over the office shortly 
after 10 am thursday but the number had dwindled to 30 by this 
morning university spokeswoman valerie galloway elijah said 
she said another eight students were outside holding up signs 
and a few were standing at the end of a stairwell and blocked by 
university officials from joining the demonstrators 
jon wentz cochairman of the democratic socialists of america 
described thursday nights meeting as very positive brother fitz 
was very cooperative with us 
he said they talked about establishing a forum on the cia and 
that the students demanded a oneyear moratorium on any cia 
recruitment 
we seem to be very confident that we will get that 
moratorium wentz said were not going to leave until we are 
guaranteed there is a moratorium 
fitz said he would have to talk with his vice presidents and 
faculty before he could commit the school to a moratorium he also 
said he was not yet committed to a forum and expected to meet again 
with the students later today 
fitz would not say whether he would order the students removed 
william c schuerman dean of the school met with student 
representatives for about an hour thursday evening 
i think weve been very clear that were offering the students 
an opportunity to discuss the issues theyre raising schuerman 
said what were not prepared to do is to meet the demands 
theyve indicated 
the cia was recruiting at the nearby kennedy union on campus 
but a statement issued by the protesters said they did not appear 
there because they did not want to infringe on the rights of 
students to interview with the agency 
the students had been told they had to leave by 430 pm 
thursday or they would face charges schuerman said they were 
allowed to stay past that deadline to avoid provoking them 
those who remained at st marys hall were charged with 
disruption under the student conduct code and later would be 
charged with trespassing under the code spokeswoman teri rizvi 
said penalties could range from a token fine to expulsion she 
said 
the protesters demanded that if university organizations invite 
the cia to recruit even off campus the school should provide a 
mandatory course for those seeking cia jobs that would detail 
alleged atrocities committed by the agency

the chief us delegate to the un human rights 
commission former cuban political prisoner armando valladares 
today rejected cuban allegations that he lied about being 
mistreated in cuban prisons 
they have had a disinformation campaign against me since 
before i left prison valladares told a news conference 
the cuban government wednesday distributed information in 
geneva washington and mexico city saying valladares had been a 
police officer under the batista government and that he had been 
arrested and jailed in 1961 because he belonged to a terrorist 
organization 
valladares and the us state department deny that he was a 
police officer and maintain that he was arrested and sentenced to 
30 years in prison for making anticommunist statements 
valladares served 22 years of his sentence before being released 
after the intervention of french president francois mitterrand 
since his release he has spoken out about what he says are 
human rights violations in cuba in particular torture and inhumane 
treatment of prisoners 
valladares told the press conference that the cuban government 
resorted to personal attacks against him because they are not 
able to deny the accusations of human rights violations he spoke 
in spanish and his remarks were translated into english 
the cuban deputy foreign minister raul roa kouri said at a 
press conference wednesday that valladares was lying when he said 
he was mistreated in prison 
valladares asked about kouris statement showed reporters 
scars on his hands which he said were from rat bites and took one 
reporters hand and ran it along his head where he said he had a 
scar from being beaten 
the united states on thursday submitted a resolution for the 
second year in a row attempting to get the commission to examine 
alleged human rights violations in cuba 
this years resolution appears to be worded more softly than 
last years which was blocked by one vote and valladares said he 
was optimistic that it would pass

prime minister yitzhak shamir today urged 
secretary of state george p shultz to move slowly on palestinian 
selfrule in the violencetorn west bank and gaza strip informed 
sources said 
shamir told shultz at a twohour meeting that there should be 
a time of testing for up to three years before negotiations are 
held on a final settlement in the occupied territories said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
shultz also met with foreign minister shimon peres leader of 
the liberal faction of israels coalition government and shamirs 
political rival 
shultz is promoting a us plan that calls for negotiations on 
an overall settlement by december but the sources said he applied 
no pressure whatsoever on shamir 
israeli soldiers today killed two more palestinians in 
antiisrael protests in the occupied territories bringing the 
death toll in 11 weeks of violence to 67 
a us official said today that some palestinians have accepted 
invitations to talk with shultz despite a palestine liberation 
organization ban and death threats the meeting was set for tonight 
in east jerusalem which israel captured from jordan in the 1967 
war 
the official said 15 moderates had been invited and a few had 
agreed to come although he declined to specify the number or 
identify invitees he spoke on condition of anonymity 
shamir later told reporters his session with shultz was very 
friendly and thorough and said they discussed the aspirations 
of all of us for getting peace 
he said he hoped that the end result would be some positive 
outcomes 
i think there are many openings said peres who has 
previously endorsed most elements of shultzs proposals i think 
there is a great deal of work to be done 
shultz said he agreed and added as always it is a great 
benefit to come and have a good long bull session about it all and 
hear your views that have been very helpful 
shultz scheduled two more sessions with shamir on sunday after 
he will have been to jordan and syria to assess arab positions 
in the talks today sources said shamir reiterated his 
objections to an international peace conference that would assign 
an active role to the soviet union 
shultz told reporters on his way here wednesday from washington 
that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze have voiced interest in such a conference in their 
meetings in moscow but shultz said it was not a way to go for 
substantive results 
shamirs position would keep alive the 1978 camp david formula 
which calls for a fiveyear period to see if the palestinians and 
israelis can live sidebyside 
negotiations on a final settlement would begin after the third 
year the options would include statehood or linking the west bank 
and gaza to jordan in a confederation 
but egypt jordan and several other countries have told the 
united states that they rejected negotiations based on the formula 
the accords produced the 1979 peace treaty between egypt and israel 
jordanian prime minister zaid rifai who will meet with shultz 
in amman on saturday said we are against any project that deals 
with partial solutions a dividing approach or projects that deal 
with palestinian autonomy 
autonomy would mean selfrule for the 15 million palestinians 
who live in the west bank and gaza but they would not have control 
over their security or conduct foreign relations two key 
attributes of statehood 
shamir aide yossi ahimeir said one shouldnt make a 
dramatization out of this one meeting its part of a process that 
will continue in washington when the prime minister goes there in 
midmarch 
prominent palestinian moderates had said they would not meet 
with shultz tonight because the united states had not fulfilled a 
plo demand to consult with palestinians living outside israeliheld 
territories 
they said this was an indication the americans were really 
seeking to create an alternative palestinian leadership to the plo 
i told shultz i regret i cannot accept because the 
palestinian people have decided that we have to have a delegation 
reflecting the true composition of the palestinian people said 
al faj newspaper editor hanna siniora who met with shultz earlier

the california supreme court has rejected 
an appeal by environmentalists and removed a major obstacle to 
drilling for oil below scenic bluffs on the southern california 
coast 
occidental petroleum corp which first applied for a permit 18 
years ago can begin exploratory drilling within a few months 
unless another court intervenes 
the supreme court now is less environmentally concerned than 
it used to be charged roger diamond a lawyer who represented 
residents of the los angeles neighborhood challenging the drilling 
the court thursday denied a hearing on an appeal of a ruling 
last november that upheld the citys 1985 approval of the drilling 
project justice stanley mosk whose son richard is one of 
occidentals lawyers did not participate in the supreme court 
action 
occidental is obviously very pleased said arthur groman 
senior member of the companys board of directors 
this field which we think may be as much as 60 million 
barrels of oil is a vital resource of the united states he said 
diamond in claiming the court had less concern about the 
environment than it used to noted that the court had blocked 
another version of the palisades project in 1974 
the lawyer also a board member of the environmental group in 
the case said opponents will ask a los angeles judge next week to 
block the drilling while a challenge to the projects coastal 
commission permit is pending 
opponents suffered another setback monday when a los angeles 
city council panel voted 32 against a proposal by councilman 
marvin braude who represents the palisades area to withdraw city 
approval of the project

the treasurer of the united 
democratic front today became the last leader of south africas 
biggest antiapartheid organization to be silenced by the state 
police came to the house of azhar cachalia this morning and 
served him with an order prohibiting him from speaking to the press 
and participating in the fronts activities 
in the east coast city of durban 14 white women members of the 
volunteer civil rights group black sash were arrested as 
demonstrations continued against the new restrictions on major 
black opposition groups 
the move against cachalia means that every national executive of 
the front group which represents 600 affiliates with 2 million 
members is either in jail in hiding or restricted by the 
government 
at the university of cape town 2000 students and staff 
gathered to protest the new bans about half marched around the 
campus carrying banners and singing god bless africa which 
many south african blacks regard as their national anthem 
the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches told the gathering that nationwide protests 
against the governments clampdown must begin immediately 
leaders of churches which like most white opposition groups 
were not targeted by the governments restrictions already have 
called for protest services in nations across the country on sunday 
the battle has only just begun boesak said we have 
decided we will resist our commitment starts right now 
when the government prohibited the front and 17 other opposition 
groups from political activity on wednesday it also issued 
restrictive orders against 18 senior black leaders including front 
presidents archie gumede and albertina sisulu 
mrs sisulu is the wife of imprisoned african national congress 
leader walter sisulu 
about half of the fronts leadership is underground many others 
are in detention without charge awaiting trial or on trial in 
connection with treason charges 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
in cape town at least one person died and five were injured 
during a clash between rival black factions in a squatter camp near 
crossroads 
the fighting between militant youths and the management 
committee of the ktc squatter camp both considered antiapartheid 
groups broke out at 3 am with gunfire and stonethrowing 
residents told journalists by 7 am 20 shacks had been burned 
police reported one dead and two injured but residents in the 
part of the camp controlled by the youths said four people were 
treated at a hospital for injuries the argus newspaper reported 
two deaths 
the fighting in the camp began last month and hundreds of shacks 
have been burned in the feuding reminiscent of the mayjune 1986 
battles in the crossroadsarea squatter camps 
in that violence 70000 people lost their homes and scores of 
people died in battles between conservative vigilantes and the 
squattercamp groups 
but this year the fighting is between two groups who had fought 
together against the vigilantes in 1986 and appears to involve 
an attempt by the militant youths to gain more power in the 
administration of the squatter camp 
police reported three blacks were killed in violence in two 
natal province towns where feuding between supporters of the 
united democratic front and the zulu political organization 
inkatha has steadily spread from the townships surrounding the 
provincial capital pietermaritzburg 
more than 400 blacks have died in the past year in the natal 
fighting

488 days in a small wooden box perched atop a telephone pole says 
shell remain threestories high for another month to raise 
100000 for cancer research 
im not sure whats in store for me but im getting pretty 
excited mellissa l sanders said an hour before overtaking a 
canadians record at 2 pm thursday 
miss sanders of tucson ariz climbed the pole oct 26 1986 
last week she rode out 75 mph winds in her swaying box 
the 42squarefoot box doesnt quite have all the comforts of 
home but its almost as wellequipped she regularly runs up 300 
telephone bills watches television and has a hair dresser who 
makes box calls she bathes in a childrens plastic pool 
her stunt has required commitment and sacrifice she said 
i gave up a good job visiting with friends driving my car 
walking around and all kinds of things for this she said 
she plans to remain in the box another month hoping a local 
radio stations support will help her raise the money necessary to 
meet her goal 
ive only raised 6000 so far it still needs to grab 
peoples attention said miss sanders whose sister rebecca is 
a cancer patient who has been in remission four years

put some money in an envelope i could make my goal she said 
ive seen telethons do it in about five minutes 
even if miss sanders has not attained her goal when she descends 
on march 24 her mother mauri rose sanders says her daughter is a 
winner 
im proud enough to burst i feel like we both did it said 
mrs sanders who broke a similar record in 1959 by sitting 211

a new law requiring consent of parents or a 
judge for an unmarried woman under 18 to have an abortion has been 
effectively blocked from being enforced this year by a ruling of 
the state supreme court 
the law sponsored by antiabortion groups had been barred from 
taking effect jan 1 by a judges order in response to a lawsuit by 
doctors and familyplanning organizations 
on thursday the high court denied the states request to lift 
that order in a unanimous decision 
the law would make it a crime for a doctor to perform an 
abortion on an unmarried woman under 18 living at home who did 
not have written consent from one parent as an alternative the 
minor could get a ruling from a judge that the abortion was in her 
best interest or that she was mature enough to make the decision on 
her own 
many other states have similar laws 
the lawsuit filed by medical and family planning organizations 
contends the law violates the right to privacy under the state 
constitution by restricting minors ability to decide whether to 
give birth or have an abortion 
some minors would be intimidated into bearing unwanted children 
and others would be delayed in getting abortions increasing the 
medical danger the suit said 
the constitutional dispute is far from resolved and could return 
to the supreme court at a later date but lawyers in the case say 
the next legal action is likely to be at least a year away either 
in appellate court proceedings or in a superior court trial 
until then minors can continue to obtain the health services 
including abortions that they need without the necessity for 
consent of a third party said abigail english of the national 
center for youth law one of the lawyers who filed suit 
state officials say some 34000 women under 18 had abortions in 
1985 the latest figures available under the old law which 
remains in effect a woman of any age can consent to an abortion as 
long as her doctor concludes she understands the procedure and is 
consenting voluntarily 
attorney general john van de kamp who personally supports 
abortion rights but as the states top law enforcement officer is 
the lead defendant in the suit had a lowkey response to the 
courts action his office said 
we dont see this as a significant ruling on the overall 
merits of the litigation said deputy attorney general allen 
ashby press spokesman for van de kamp who said the attorney 
general would proceed with an appeal

the state supreme court has permanently 
removed six judges and barred two others from completing their 
elected terms because they took cash gifts ranging from 200 to 
500 from a union leader 
a year ago the eight judges were suspended from the bench after 
the allegations of taking cash surfaced during an fbi racketeering 
investigation of the roofers union 
chief justice robert nc nix jr said taking cash from the 
union affected the judges impartiality and ordered that the 
judges salaries roughly 80000 a year cease immediately 
only one judge denied receiving the cash the others said they 
considered the money a gift not a bribe 
the judges had collected their salaries and benefits while the 
pennsylvania judicial inquiry and review board considered the 
cases last august the board recommended removal from the bench 
the pennsylvania supreme court holding that a public trust 
has been betrayed concurred unanimously thursday in a 43page 
opinion 
district attorney ronald castille hailed the decision 
it is a strong message to judges everywhere that this kind of 
conduct is totally inappropriate this is an important first step 
in rebuilding the citizens confidence to get justice back in 
city hall he said 
mark a aronchick a lawyer for common pleas judge mary rose 
fante cunningham who was permanently removed from the bench said 
cunningham was just saddened about the whole thing 
james c schwartzman a lawyer for common pleas judge michael 
wallace who was permanently removed said the penalty was far too 
severe 
stephen p gallagher a lawyer for municipal judge thomas 
dempsey who was barred from completing his term said he had not 
talked with his client but im sure hell be unhappy 
and charles cunningham a lawyer for common pleas judge william 
porter who was barred for the rest of his term said the court had 
drawn a significant distinction with its sentence for porter 
and dempsey since they will be allowed to try to return to the 
bench in the future 
the case and other bribery scandals in which three judges have 
been convicted have rocked the philadelphia court system in the 
past year 
six other judges also suspended last year are under 
investigation 
the eight judges were accused of accepting 200 to 500 from 
1983 to 1985 from stephen traitz jr former leader of roofers 
union local 3030b 
traitz and 18 other union members were convicted last year of 
extortion and bribery they had been accused of trying to bribe 
more than 50 public officials

the national collegiate athletic associations 
drug testing program does not violate a students privacy rights a 
federal judge has ruled 
us district judge walter mcgoverns decision thursday also 
upheld the university of washingtons right to enforce the drug 
test program 
on the lawsuit brought by cross country and track athlete betsy 
ohalloran 19 mcgovern said the invasion of her privacy 
interest by the specimen collection procedures of the drugtesting 
program is outweighed by the ncaas interest in protecting 
student athletes health reducing temptations to use drugs and 
ensuring fair competitions 
i think the decision is correct in all particulars and 
accurately stated the law said jack kitchin a lawyer for the 
ncaa in kansas city mo 
the american civil liberties union which filed the suit on 
behalf of ohalloran and another athlete who later joined the case 
will likely appeal to the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
kathleen taylor of the aclu 
its a defeat in a way ohalloran said but i think weve 
got a great chance in the 9th circuit i really dont think his 
arguments are very good 
ohalloran initially filed suit against the university for its 
mandatory drug testing program and a king county superior court 
judge ruled in july that the university program was a violation of 
both state and us constitutional privacy rights 
but that oral ruling was never formally entered and the ncaa 
was ordered to be a defendant in the case which was then moved to 
federal court 
last month the university of washington dropped the mandatory 
aspect of its drug testing program revising it so that testing was 
voluntary and required only for those athletes suspected of drug 
use 
the claim against the university program was then dismissed 
with the claim against the ncaa program and the universitys 
participation in it remaining 
uw athletes are still required to sign a drug testing consent 
form required by the ncaa mike lude the universitys athletic 
director said ohalloran would be welcomed back if she complies 
with the ncaa rules and signs a consent form 
i will not do that ohalloran said thursday night 
under ncaa rules students must consent to be tested before 
regular season competition begins although the random testing 
would not occur until postseason playoff time 
students who refuse to sign are prohibited from regular season 
competition 
ohalloran asked mcgovern to grant her a preliminary injunction 
allowing her to compete for the womens track team this spring 
but mcgovern denied her request saying any harm done to her by 
being barred from competition was outweighed by the potentially 
greater harm to the ncaa if its effective regulation of 
intercollegiate athletics was to be impaired

classes were canceled today for nearly 73000 
pupils in ohios largest school district after teachers rejected a 
contract offer and set up picket lines 
talks were scheduled to resume at 1 pm today according to 
federal mediator jack buettner 
principals and administrative staff will reopen four high 
schools monday for 3600 seniors superintendent alfred tutela 
said teachers had planned to strike thursday but the district 
declared a snow day and closed all buildings

am thursday after two days of negotiations 
at a regularly scheduled school board meeting thursday evening 
mildred madison board president said she believed the board had 
made a fair offer 
more than 100 students and teachers attended the meeting and 
many were unhappy over negotiating efforts by school officials 
its the students who really need the education here reubin 
fitzhugh a senior at clevelands aviation high school told the 
board you have your education why cant we have ours 
the school board reportedly has dropped its demand that a 
mandatory career ladder system be included in the new contract

would have linked teacher advancement and pay raises to performance 
evaluations

payment with further raises contingent on passage of a tax levy 
union president eugene kolach said the board had revised its offer 
to a 2 percent raise retroactive to september and another 1

a soldier of fortune magazine ad subject of a 
negligence suit that seeks millions of dollars in damages does not 
fall under first amendment protection because the ad represents a 
commercial form of speech a federal judge says 
us district judge david hittner issued the written opinion 
thursday elaborating on a pretrial decision that refused to 
dismiss the 225 million suit filed against the magazine by the 
family of a texas woman slain in 1985 
in an eightpage decision hittner cited several federal rulings 
that allowed negligence suits where commercial speech was the issue 
according to the judge the magazine acknowledges that the ad 
fell into the realm of commercial speech and to allow dismissal of 
the suit under first amendment grounds would afford to commercial 
speech a broader protection than that given core speech 
gary black 18 and marjorie einmann 64 are suing the 
selfstyled journal for professional adventurers for running a 
classified ad that led to the killing of sandra black gary blacks 
mother and mrs einmanns daughter 
robert black is on texas death row for paying john wayne hearn 
10000 to kill his wife at her bryan home in february 1985 hearn 
is serving three life terms in florida for the black slaying and 
two others in that state 
hearns ad appeared in four issues of the magazine in late 1984 
offering services of former marine and vietnam veterans and weapons 
specialists with jungle warfare expertise for highrisk 
assignments in the united states or overseas 
attorneys for the magazine do not dispute that the ad brought 
hearn and black together but insist that soldier of fortune 
publisher robert brown had no way of knowing the ad was for illegal 
activity brown has testified he would have halted the classified 
ads for personal services if he had known they were linked to 
crimes 
brown publisher and founder of the boulder colobased 
magazine was expected to return to the stand today as the trial 
completed a second week he was called last week as an adverse 
witness for the plaintiffs and his attorneys reserved 
crossexamination until later 
a former top editor at the magazine testified thursday he 
favored elimination of classified ads from the publication because 
they were journalistically unprofessional 
william guthrie now a freelance writer living in idaho said 
the ads continued despite his objections because brown thought they 
lent an air of mystique to the publication 
certain kinds of classified ads appeared to trivialize the 
magazine said guthrie who was executive editor before leaving 
in 1986 if soldier of fortune was trying to look like a 
legitimate military news magazine to have ads for brass knuckles 
and so forth seemed inappropriate 
guthrie said he was not aware that any of the ads may have been 
linked to criminal activity

a judge dropped contemptofcourt 
citations against 34 firefighters but ordered their union to pay a 
25000 fine for a threeday sickout 
the president of the union thursday read a letter of apology to 
the court for not doing more to comply with a backtowork order 
issued on the first day of the sickout that eventually involved 110 
firefighters 
leo j miller the president of local 799 of the international 
association of firefighters also promised to monitor all sick 
leave that appears to be excessive in the future 
later miller said the apology was not an admission that 
firefighters had participated in any type of job action job 
actions by municipal employees are illegal under rhode island law 
superior court judge americo campanella told miller he was 
fining the union in order to impress upon you the importance 
of a court order 
the 34 firefighters failed to appear before campanella on monday 
afternoon after they were served notice by the city to appear in 
court 
city labor lawyer vincent ragosta jr said he was pleased with 
the ruling but said the city will press a civil suit to recover 
100000 spent on overtime during the sickout the fire department 
kept its night shift on duty throughout the sickout no major fires 
occurred during the three days 
the city said the firefighters called in sick 50 out of 51 on 
saturday and all 60 on sunday to protest what they believed were 
unilateral changes made in their contract by the city the walkout 
ended tuesday 
the city has yet to sign the agreement ratified by the union in 
december though it has been honoring wage and benefit increases 
the dispute according to fire chief michael f moise concerned 
the unions insistence that rescue truck crews have the highest 
level of emergency medical technician training

outnumbered senate republicans held ranks 
today scuttling a lastditch democratic attempt to force a vote on 
a divisive campaign finance package that kept lawmakers talking for 
53 straight hours 
the gop victory capping a sometimes bitter filibuster that 
included the parliamentary arrest of sen robert packwood rore 
came as the senate voted 5341 not to invoke cloture which would 
have cut off debate and brought the legislation to a vote the 
majority democrats would win 
the cloture attempt failed because at least 60 senators must 
agree to force a vote it was the eighth time since june that 
majority leader robert byrd dwva had lost a cloture motion on 
campaign spending 
the defeat seemingly doomed any chance of congress passing the 
democratic plan this year to impose voluntary spending limits for 
senate campaigns but byrd left the door ajar 
we will revisit the issue in one form or another he said 
before the vote its not going to go away 
acting minority leader alan simpson rwyo said the 
republicans would be waiting 
there will be other proposals like this when they come up 
they will be dealt with like this simpson said 
this weeks struggle centered on a plan advanced by 52 senators 
including republicans robert stafford of vermont and john chafee of 
rhode island to attack the escalating cost of campaigns by 
imposing spending limits 
limits for a senate general election race would range from 
950000 to 55 million depending on a states population in 
1986 the average campaign cost 3 million up fivefold from 1976 
with some big state races topping 10 million per candidate 
sen david boren dokla one of the bills authors said that 
to build a 3 million warchest a senator must raise 10000 every 
week from the time he or she arrives in washington until the end of 
the sixyear term 
a candidate observing the limit would be eligible for subsidized 
mailings rockbottom radio and tv ad rates and money from the 
treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or the candidate was 
the target of heavy spending by independent groups 
the legislation also takes aim at the increasing role of 
specialinterest political action committees which in 1986 
provided over half the campaign money raised by more than 200 house 
and senate candidates most of them incumbents under the plan 
pacs could supply no more than 20 percent of the candidates 
spending limit 
except for stafford and chafee republicans are having no part 
of the proposal which they say would favor democrats and doom them 
to continued minority status in heavily democratic states 
particularly in the south 
sen warren rudman rnh calls it the incumbent protection 
act because he said it would hamper challengers with little 
name recognition or financial resources 
everyone in politics knows that with these limits what we 
absolutely say to most challengers is youve had it rudman 
said 
democrats rejected this argument saying that the real question 
was the public perception of senators scurrying for contributions 
to fuel increasingly expensive campaigns 
we have to spend our time running around the country looking 
for a handout byrd said how can we blame anyone from 
perceiving us as corrupt the system is corrupt and were trying to 
reform it 
the senate should not be owned by an aristocracy of money 
he said campaign reform gives the little guy an equal share 
this business of the golden handshake nobody likes it senators 
dont want to spend all their time going from fundraiser to 
fundraiser with their hand out begging for money 
republicans were forced into the filibuster at 2 pm tuesday 
when byrd placed the legislation before the senate within 12 
hours things turned bitter with the parliamentary arrest of sen 
robert packwood rore 
acting on the orders of democrats capitol police pushed into 
his office and carried him feetfirst into the chamber giving byrd 
the quorum at least 51 present members he needed to keep the 
filibuster going 
republicans talked of banana republic tactics byrd called 
them crybabies and castigated them for deserting the chamber en 
masse in an effort to abort the talkathon 
this was a calculated effort to obstruct the senate from doing 
its work byrd said i was forced to do it order arrests to 
get a majority of the senate present so the senate could do its 
business 
byrd forced the filibuster in an effort to get the gop to 
negotiate republicans said they were willing to talk about curbing 
pac money but they steadfastly drew the line at spending limits 
at the start of the filibuster byrd said he was ready to keep 
the senate in continuous session through the end of next week 
but by midnight wednesday he and gop leaders had agreed to end 
the siege thursday evening let everyone get a nights sleep and 
return for todays cloture vote

a top uaw official says he will give 
local unions permission to strike on a plantbyplant basis in an 
attempt to discourage the company from selling its 1 billion 
partsmaking subsidiary 
more than 1000 angry workers massed outside chrysler 
headquarters in 20degree temperatures thursday chanting strike 
strike to protest the proposed sale of acustar inc which 
employs 28000 workers and represents nearly a fifth of chryslers 
worldwide operations 
you do whatever you need to do and you know what to do 
uaw vice president marc stepp told the demonstrators the rally 
followed a special meeting of the 140delegate chrysler bargaining 
council representing the companys 49 uaw locals 
although the union cant legally call a national strike against 
chrysler over acustar stepp said he will give local uaw unions 
permission to strike on a plantbyplant basis over unresolved 
issues such as healthandsafety grievances 
a series of local strikes at key chrysler plants could shut down 
the company nationwide 
at least seven chrysler locals have voted to seek strike 
authorization and one a key 4000worker stamping plant in 
sterling heights should receive authorization as early as next 
week stepp predicted 
stepp said the possible acustar sale which chrysler chairman 
lee iacocca confirmed in early february threatens the jobs of all 
chrysler workers by weakening their bargaining power and reducing 
work opportunities within the corporation 
the council unanimously passed a resolution calling for 
suspension of all joint labormanagement programs that require 
trust and cooperation including special teamconcept agreements at 
six plants unless chrysler decides not to sell acustar 
chrysler has begun implementing the socalled modern operating 
agreements at plants in huntsville ala and in indianapolis and 
newcastle ind 
local union leaders said they immediately will stop attending 
labormanagement plant meetings 
similar agreements in which workers share tasks as part of a 
team have not yet taken effect at plants in detroit newark del 
and trenton nj stepp said 
chrysler has said it may sell acustar because it doesnt want to 
invest in the research needed to upgrade some operations chrysler 
already buys 70 percent of its parts from outside sources 
workers say they are angry at the possible sale because they 
made concessions and helped iacocca win loan guarantees from the 
federal government to rescue the company from the verge of 
bankruptcy at the beginning of the decade 
stepp will lead negotiations with chrysler this summer to 
replace its contract which expires sept 14 stepp said chrysler 
already has made talks more difficult with its announcement last 
month that it will close its assembly plant in kenosha wis by 
the end of the year

passengers aboard cruise ships that have passed 
federal sanitation inspections are less likely to suffer diarrhea 
during their vacations federal health officials said 
travelers ought to be aware that these are very tough 
inspections far tougher than the usual restaurant inspections done 
ashore said dr vernon houk director of the national centers 
for disease controls center for environmental health 
but houk cautioned against reading too much into the inspection 
reports 
the individual traveler should not look at a single inspection 
report and make that the determinant whether hell travel on that 
ship or not he said it seems to me the useful question is 
what is the past history of this ship 
cdc researchers said thursday that ships that consistently 
have the highest sanitation scores are less likely to have an 
outbreak of diarrheal disease than ships with lower average 
scores 
on the average for every 10 million passengerdays one 
passenger sailing one day fewer than two of the ships scoring in 
the top 20 percent reported diarrhea outbreaks between 1975 when 
the sanitation program began and 1985 
that compares with outbreaks aboard more than eight of the ships 
scoring in the bottom 20 percent the cdc said 
the cdc considers an outbreak in progress if 3 percent of the 
passengers and crew are ill sanitation inspections monitor water 
quality food storage and preparation potential for food 
contamination cleanliness and other matters 
the cdc has no power to block a ship from sailing but does 
distribute the results of its inspections 
the agency also said the percentage of ships passing inspection 
rose dramatically over the programs first decade while the number 
of intestinal illness outbreaks among passengers declined 
in 1975 cruise ships reported 77 outbreaks of diarrhea for 
every million passengerdays sailed houk said by 1985 the figure 
dropped to 27 outbreaks 
this has been a cooperative effort between us and the cruise 
ship industry and the study clearly shows it has been 
working houk said things are going in the right direction

us treasury secretary james a baker 
iii said today that he called on the government here to speed up 
appreciation of its currency to help reduce the growing us trade 
deficit with south korea 
baker said he also discussed other trade issues including the 
lifting of a ban on imports of us beef an easing of restrictions 
on american cigarettes and protection of us intellectual property 
rights 
baker who visited south korea for president roh taewoos 
inauguration said in an airport news conference before leaving 
that his talks with south korean officials were friendly and useful 
baker said south koreas currency the won was undervalued 
against the dollar but did not say how much it should be revalued 
a higher value for the won would make south korean products more 
expensive and less competitive overseas 
south korean officials said baker pointed out that the wons 
appreciation has been slower than that of the japanese yen and 
taiwanese dollar which both gained close to 30 percent against the 
us dollar last year the won rose only 87 percent 
finance ministry officials said they told baker that south korea 
would actively adjust the wons value by taking into account the 
value of the dollar on international money markets and the impact 
on domestic industries 
local newspapers reported that baker asked for a 15 percent to 
20 percent rise in the won and for south korea to open its stock 
market to foreign investors 
baker said that problems have developed that need to be 
addressed in a spirit of cooperation by the two countries 
he said the us trade deficit with south korea grew 39 percent 
last year following a 57 percent increase in 1986 and that it was 
approximately equal to south koreas entire current account 
surplus which hit a record 978 billion last year 
he said the united states should be given more access to the 
south korean market because while the us market is nearly 
completely open to korean goods some of our exporters experience 
serious impediments to their access to the korean market he 
cited high tariffs other trade barriers and an undervalued 
exchange rate

there was only one guy still in the helicopter who was either 
the pilot or the copilot and he was conscious berry said he 
was so conscious that when i cut his seatbelt he said that feels 
better thanks 
jack souther 54 used a small fire extinguisher from his pickup 
truck to douse burning bodies the only thing i could do was put

vice president george bush during a 
campaign stop here said the united states should do whatever is 
necessary including military force to protect american interests 
in panama 
bush stopped short of calling for military intervention in 
panama in the wake of the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle 
saying that the united states past history of intervention in 
latin american affairs is whats hurting us in some areas now 
he told the south carolina press association we will do 
whatever is necessary to protect american interests in panama 
weve got treaty interests on the panama canal i dont want to 
rattle any sabers 
but we would obviously as the united states and i would 
reserve the right to do whatever is necessary including military 
force to protect americas sacred interest in that region of the 
world 
the vice president given a strong south carolina lead in a poll 
published today was heading for atlanta after a day of campaigning 
thursday in south carolina whose republican presidential primary 
is saturday march 5 
a poll by the charlotte observer indicated bush was the favorite 
in the states gop contest with the support of 41 percent of those 
likely to vote in the primary 
sen bob dole trailed with 29 percent former television 
evangelist pat robertson had 13 percent and rep jack kemp had 4 
percent twelve percent were undecided 
on thursday bush seemed to be confidently raising the stakes as 
he declared south carolina is going to stand alone as the 
forerunner of who is going to be president in my view 
bush traveled by motorcade through the states northwestern 
corner stopping at colleges technical schools a high school 
popular restaurants and a sidewalk crowd in nearby greenwood 
at one of his first stops bush addressed headon the issue of 
the regions major textile industry and the calls by its leaders 
for limits on foreign imports textile leaders contend the industry 
has been damaged by cheap imports and they want legislation 
imposing limits on foreign products brought into the united states 
bush referred to that as a pure allout protectionist 
policy that may cost three other jobs while saving one he said 
existing trade laws are adequate if enforced 
thats not the answer bush said the answer is we can 
compete if the playing field is level i will enforce the laws i 
will guarantee you that there is every effort made towards fair 
trade 
a day earlier rival bob dole campaigned in the state and pledged 
to support the legislation in the senate similar to legislation 
that president reagan vetoed over textilestate objections two 
years ago 
bush argued that south carolinas economy has been growing and 
pointed to figures he said show 62000 new jobs were created in the 
state last year including 2700 in textiles he contended currency 
differences with japan are improving and that manufacturing and 
agricultural imports have climbed recently 
were seeing improvement out there he said 
bush cited evidence of economic improvement at most every stop 
but didnt repeat his opposition to the textile import limits until 
asked there have got to be some changes before id be for it 
he said 
bush rode in his armored limo for most of the day but spent one 
leg of the trip on a bus with about 40 active supporters from the 
area 
he said that doles endorsement by sen strom thurmond makes 
the stakes higher for dole in south carolina thurmond however 
didnt provide enough help to make a difference for his gop primary 
favorite eight years ago texan john connally 
bush was accompanied by south carolina gov carroll a campbell 
jr his state chairman and national campaign manager lee atwater 
a native south carolinian 
atwater attached much significance to the states primary even 
while arguing bush could withstand a loss here he said that if 
robertson fails to beat bush in south carolina he wont win a 
single state 
and atwater said if dole finishes third in south carolina i 
think hes going to lose every single state on super tuesday when 
20 states including all the rest of the south hold primaries 
the observers poll conducted by the newspapers market 
research division surveyed 687 registered voters who indicated 
they were likely to participate in the primary the margin of error 
is 4 percentage points the newspaper said

president reagan was just being realistic 
in saying that there isnt enough time to finish work on a 
ussoviet strategic weapons treaty before his planned summit 
meeting in moscow white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
today 
reagan in an interview published in todays washington post 
also said he believes it is still possible for the treaty to be 
completed and signed before he leaves office in january 
us and soviet negotiatiors had hoped to have the treaty ready 
for reagan to sign with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev when the 
two meet in moscow in may or june 
fitzwater said the presidents statements did not represent any 
major change in the us position 
the president said the same thing that i have said here many 
times that secretary of state george shultz and others have 
said and that is that we are working on a start agreement if we 
can get one that will be done in time to sign at the summit that 
would be great but realistically it doesnt appear thats likely 
to happen 
the president was just being realistic fitzwater said 
during a 30minute oval office interview with the post on 
thursday reagan was asked whether he expected to sign the treaty 
to reduce strategic or longrange nuclear weapons by 50 percent 
during the summit 
that would be nice if it could happen but i have to tell you 
that common sense indicates that the time is too limited for us to 
really think that we could bring a treaty ready for signature to 
that meeting reagan said 
were not at this moment anticipating that it would be ready 
for signature then he said 
reagan said the negotiations being conducted by representatives 
of both sides at the strategic arms reductions talks in geneva are 
far more complex than those that preceded the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty which was signed by the two leaders during 
the washington summit in december the inf treaty eliminated 
shortand intermediaterange missiles from europe it is awaiting 
action by the senate 
this one is so much more complicated with regard to 
verification and everything else than the inf treaty which we were 
able to bring together but even that took a few months to do 
reagan said 
i believe with the amount of time that would still be 
remaining that if there is sincerity on both sides with regard to 
getting such an agreement and i think there is i think that 
could be done before my time expired he said 
he reiterated that he would not use the strategic defense 
initiative known as star wars as a bargaining chip in 
negotiations with the soviet union 
i have told him gorbachev every time if it is that 
good we are going to deploy it we see it as the basis then for 
eliminating the strategic ballistic missiles on both sides and i 
have even told him that i would be willing to see this shared 
the president said 
reagan also said national security adviser lt gen colin powell 
and secretary of state george p shultz are convinced the soviets 
want to pull out of afghanistan where they have been battling 
usbacked rebels 
i think that a large part of that could be the economic 
situation in the soviet union and the fact that after going on 
nine years its still a stalemate so i think that theres reason 
to believe that they really want out he said 
a group of senators back from a tour of nato capitals said they 
won assurances from reagan on thursday that the strategic arms 
treaty would not be rushed through simply to have it ready for 
signing at the moscow summit 
i am very concerned that the start agreement not be based on 
the calendar the day of the month that it not be governed by 
meeting a deadline said senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva 
he said he was assured that would not be the case 
on monday during shultzs talks with soviet leaders in moscow 
us and soviet negotiators at the start talks in geneva had been 
directed to prepare within a month three draft agreements for a 
treaty to reduce longrange nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 
percent 
draft accords on verification disposing of weapons and exchange 
of information are to be ready for the next meeting between shultz 
and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze scheduled for 
march 2223 in washington 
other issues covered during the post interview included 
the us budget deficit its a burden theres no question 
about that but not the disaster some people proclaim one 
of the major factors in our budget right now is the interest but 
who gets that interest and you find out then that a great many 
institutions universities educational institutions of all kinds 
that part of their endowment are government bonds and so a lot of 
that interest is going to them and to individual americans 
former white house aides michael deaver convicted of perjury 
for lying about his lobbying activities and lyn nofziger 
convicted of illegal lobbying and attorney general edwin meese 
iii who is being investigated by an independent counsel of 
course i am saddened i found all those individuals to be the 
very soul of integrity in the more than 20 years that i have known 
them

for three long minutes air traffic 
controllers at the denver air route traffic control center were 
without radar systems to track planes in parts of nine western 
states relying instead on manual calculations 
the primary computer system used to track air traffic failed at 
614 pm thursday and controllers were unable to switch to the 
backup system until 617 pm because it had been taken apart for 
maintenance said lee fryer a duty officer for the federal 
aviation administration in seattle 
during those three minutes air traffic controllers had to keep 
the traffic separated by using manual calculations 
a controller who was working during the shutdown said that the 
equipment failure lasted longer than three minutes three minutes 
is optimistic on the faa side he said safety at the center was 
most definitely compromised said the controller who asked

gov mario cuomo today accused lawyers for a 
black teenager who says she was assaulted by six white men of 
making up conditions as part of their continuing refusal to 
have the young woman testify about the case 
meanwhile the teenagers aunt was quoted today as saying the 
girl hadnt even talked about the case with the lawyers 
representing her 
tawana brawley 16 missing for four days in november was found 
wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and covered with feces with 
racial insults scrawled on her body she said she was assaulted by 
six white men one of whom flashed a police badge 
miss brawley of wappingers falls north of new york city and 
her family have refused to be questioned further on the advice of 
attorneys c vernon mason and alton maddox jr of new york city 
the lawyers who used a similar tactic to get a special prosecutor 
appointed in the howard beach manslaughter case 
cuomo had nothing good to say about those lawyers at an 
impromptu news conference today 
they said they had reasons they could not cooperate its 
clear now they dont really cuomo said of the two lawyers 
these conditions obviously dont mean anything they keep making 
up new conditions 
maddox and mason were on the road this morning and not 
immediately available for comment on cuomos statements or todays 
report in the middletown times herald record newspaper that miss 
brawley hadnt talked to the lawyers about the case 
cuomo said again today that he was willing to meet with miss 
brawley if it would help push the stalled investigation along 
however he said he would do so only if her lawyers approved and 
state attorney general robert abrams cuomos special prosecutor in 
the case said it would be helpful 
in her interview with the middletown newspaper juanita brawley 
who helped raise tawana for eight years and who has spent time with 
her since her attack said she is the only one who knows enough 
about the incident to keep the lawyers and the girls mother 
informed 
i know a few things that no one else knows she said in an 
interview at her home she said of maddox he has not talked to 
tawana he does not need to talk to tawana she did not elaborate 
on thursday the rev al sharpton said the brawley family would 
go to jail before testifying before a grand jury empaneled by 
abrams 
sharpton a minister from new york city who has said he is 
advising the family said cuomo is using macho politics in 
trying to compel tawanas testimony 
on wednesday cuomo had called on abrams to ask a grand jury 
when it convenes monday in poughkeepsie to force miss brawley and 
her family to cooperate with investigators 
someone is going to give him a macho award for beating up on a 
young girl who has already been abused sharpton said of cuomo 
this morning cuomo said that whatever happened with the grand 
jury he thought it was very unlikely that tawana would be sent 
to jail even if she continued her refusal to cooperate with abrams 
investigation 
on thursday cuomo had told new york city radio station wlib 
that he cant understand why the brawley family will not cooperate 
with authorities 
i see no reason no commonsense reason no 
difficulttounderstand reason why there is not cooperation 
cuomo said at one point you have to ask yourself why arent 
they cooperating with the prosecutors

mikhail s gorbachev today made an unprecedented 
public appeal for calm in the protestplagued republic of armenia 
but thousands ignored him and took to the streets in a sea of 
banners witnesses said 
for the past five days protesters have jammed the center of 
yerevan armenias capital to demand that a region of the 
neighboring republic of azerbaidzhan nagornokarabakh whose 
population is more than threequarters armenian be made part of 
armenia 
the communist party central committee over which gorbachev 
presides as party general secretary rejected the call earlier this 
month that sparked street protests in yerevan in numbers without 
precedent in the 70 years of soviet history 
sergei grigoryants an armenian dissident said a speech from 
gorbachev was read over armenian staterun radio at 11 am by 
vladimir i dolgikh a nonvoting member of the ruling politburo 
it was later read by dolgikh over local television said gevorg 
mirozyan an editor at armenian gostelradio the state broadcasting 
authority 
gorbachev called on the armenian people to be calm and said 
there were a lot of unresolved problems including that of 
nargornokarabakh and that a patient approach is required 
grigoryants told the associated press by telephone from yerevan 
the 15minute speech also was broadcast over loudspeakers at 
yerevan airport and elsewhere in the city said grigoryants a 
moscow resident who arrived in armenia earlier today 
demonstrators also watched the address on tv monitors that had 
been set up on in yerevans streets said valery aidinyan chief of 
the propaganda department at the local communist party newspaper 
kommunist 
gorbachev said the central committee intends to devote one of 
its next plenary meetings to examining relations among the 
countrys more than 100 ethnic groups 
the soviet union has recently faced ethnic problems among the 
baltic republics and in the central asian republic of kazakhstan 
where three people were killed and 200 injured in rioting dec 
1718 1986 
armenia the smallest of the 15 soviet republics in area has 
34 million people 
grigoryants said gorbachevs speech was more conciliatory and 
soothing than combative remarks made wednesday night in yerevan 
by dolgikh but he said it failed to sway protesters 
the numbers in the streets have grown to more than 1 million 
today grigoryants said columns are marching along the major 
streets and there is a sea of banners 
several hours later aidinyan said the demonstrators had begun 
to disperse a worker at the yerevan hotel speaking on condition 
of anonymity confirmed that by nighfall virtually all of the 
demonstrators had left the city center 
there is no disorder everyone is working again he said by 
telephone 
factories scientific institutes and the armenian telegraph 
agency reportedly went on strike in sympathy with the protest 
armenians who had served with the soviet army in afghanistan were 
said to be among the protesters throwing away their medals and 
their communist party membership cards 
the protests in yerevan now in their fifth straight day 
constitute a clear challenge to gorbachevs campaign for greater 
democratization and openness gorbachevs personal appeal showed 
how seriously the kremlin regards the situation 
there has been no official estimate of the number of protesters 
and the staterun travel agency intourist has refused to allow 
moscowbased reporters to travel to yerevan 
ayrikyan said that before midnight thursday 1500 soviet 
paratroopers had been flown into yerevan and were ferried in a 
40vehicle motorcade to the dynamo sports hall and other locations 
around the republics capital 
they came with full equipment including clubs ayrikyan 
said he said paratroopers were told by officers aboard their 
transport planes that an uprising for national independence was 
under way in armenia but would not say how he obtained the 
information 
ayrikyan a former political prisoner who spent 17 years in 
labor camps and exile for alleged nationalist behavior called the 
arrival of the paratroopers an interference in armenias 
affairs each of the soviet unions 15 republics is ostensibly 
independent 
mofses gorgisyan 26 a member of an armenian underground group 
called the alliance for national determination told the ap by 
phone from yerevan thursday that other soldiers took up positions 
in the citys downtown area and stationed tanks in the outskirts 
a 17yearold resident of nagornokarabakh said after arriving 
in moscow thursday that virtually the entire armenian population of 
the region about 120000 people has been demonstrating daily in 
the main city stepanakert since feb 13 
the student who spoke on condition she not be identified said 
protests were continuing roundtheclock and that schools and 
businesses were closed in a strike 
she also said some armenians in her region had been killed by 
azeris members of the dominant ethnic group in azerbaidzhan but 
that she had did not know how many or the circumstances 
soviet officials have said there were victims of the unrest 
but did not give other information

on the eve of what would have been the 
greatest challenge of his 30year legal career the man who has 
been impeached gov evan mechams lead lawyer for months has 
resigned 
murray miller 60 who with his son has defended the governor 
through impeachment proceedings as well as mechams criminal 
indictment said in a brief interview today that i was fully in 
charge of the case as late as wednesay night after his 
appearance before the senate impeachment court 
miller still was acting for the governor thursday evening in 
filing motions with the senate challenging the adequacy of the 
impeachment charges but he would say today only that the decision 
to withdraw came thursday night and that he hoped the senate would 
not suspect that he had deceived it 
as for mecham miller said my main concern is that the 
governor gets a fair legal shake 
earlier miller had said a lynch mob atmosphere was 
undermining his fight to save the governor from an impeachment 
conviction 
theyre trying to sandbag the governor miller had said 
referring to mechams foes in and out of the state senate which is 
scheduled to convene as a court monday 
if they convict him they can also stamp the dracula clause 
said the metaphorprone attorney they can bar him from holding 
office for life putting the stake through his heart 
miller declined to discuss the reasons for his resignation 
however mecham hired five additional attorneys early this week 
including jerris leonard a washington attorney and former 
congressman and miller said earlier the leonard move came as a 
surprise 
that was the first time i met him when he walked in here on 
tuesday miller had said with a shrug i spoke with the 
governor and he said he was bringing leonard on board for 
advice 
the senate dealt leonard a setback wednesday night however 
rebuffing his plea for a delay to let him catch up on the case but 
agreeing to let leonard join the defense team miller had said at 
the time he would be the lead counsel at the beginning because 
he was most familiar with the case 
leonard resigned from the washington law firm of manatt phelps 
rothenberg tunney and evans because of his decision to take the 
case charles t manatt a senior partner confirmed today 
jerris leonard informed the firm last week that he had been 
contacted by gov mecham concerning representation manatt said 
we made it clear that the firm was not interested in representing 
governor mecham and mr leonard informed us that he has resigned 
from the firm 
the 23count impeachment accused mecham of concealing a campaign 
loan diverting money from the governors protocol fund for private 
use and obstructing justice in the investigation of a death threat 
allegation 
miller said he believes mecham is innocent but that it is 
impossible for the republican governor to get a fair trial even 
though the gop controls both houses of the legislature 
you really have a lynch mob atmosphere in the city miller 
said 
youre not dealing with a neutral jury he said youre 
dealing with senators who may be predisposed against the governor 
ill try to beseech them to keep an open mind but politicians 
being what they are im not sure thats going to be possible 
if mecham faces difficult odds he had in miller an attorney who 
knows how it feels to be an underdog 
described by colleagues as talkative and tenacious the new 
yorkborn lawyer is the son of european immigrants and was the 
youngest of six children raised in a onebath twobedroom brooklyn 
tenement 
miller recalled nostalgically how he waded through snowdrifts to 
carry his fathers lunch to his upholstery shop 
oh dad youre telling those stories again chided his son 
rick 28 who joined his fathers law practice a year ago another 
miller son is a court stenographer and a third is about to enter 
law school 
miller was sent by the army to new mexico where he met and 
married zelda cohen a registered nurse and attended the 
university of new mexico 
a job selling xray equipment brought them to arizona where he 
decided to try law school mrs miller worked to pay his tuition at 
the university of arizona and in 1958 he set up a oneman practice 
we were really broke he recalled of the days when he 
accepted any case that came along 
his current clients include max dunlap a contractor who is 
suing phoenix for 650 million over his subsequently reversed 
conviction in the carbomb slaying of newspaper investigative 
reporter don bolles

consumer prices rose a moderate 03 percent in 
january about the same rate of inflation as through 1987 but a 
large decline in energy costs cloaked hefty increases in many other 
areas the government reported friday 
the january increase in the labor departments consumer price 
index followed a revised december increase of 02 percent the 
december rise initially been reported as 01 percent 
the advance was equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 42 
percent according to department analysts that compares to the 44 
percent actual rate of inflation posted for 1987 and is also in 
line with the reagan administrations projection of 43 percent 
inflation for 1988 
but while most analysts do not see a major acceleration of 
inflation this year januarys figures showed particularly steep 
increases in the category of services 
medical care services rose 08 percent its steepest increase in 
two years the cost of hospital rooms was up 12 percent 
physicians bills were up 10 percent 
rent costs rose 11 per cent auto insurance prices were up 15 
percent and entertaintment costs rose 09 percent 
analysts said that many of the price increases may reflect 
onetimeonly increases timed to coincide with the beginning of the 
year 
but donald ratajczak a georgia state university economist who 
specializes in price activity called the report a bit 
worrisome 
we didnt expect that much of a rise in services he said 
it does appear that there was some aggressive pricing going on in 
january we should see some calming in february 
in another economic reports friday 
the commerce department said americans personal incomes and 
consumer spending both rose at moderate rates of 03 percent in 
january less than half the 07 gains both posted in december 
economists expect weakening consumer spending this year as the 
economy slows down 
a real estate trade group said sales of existing homes fell 36 
percent in january the third consecutive monthly decline the 
national association of realtors said that sales of existing 
singlefamily homes were at their slowest pace since june 1985 
januarys consumer inflation level would have been higher had it 
not been for the second consecutive monthly decline in energy costs 
in fact subtracting the usually volatile food and energy 
categories consumer prices for all other goods and services rose a 
sharp 05 percent in january equivalent to about a 6 percent 
annual inflation rate after a 02 percent increase in this 
category in december 
overall energy prices fell 07 percent in january after a 08 
percent drop in december 
gasoline prices fell 16 percent heating oil costs were down 
08 percent natural gas prices dropped 01 percent and electricity 
charges were down 03 percent 
food prices meanwhile rose but not as much as they had in the 
previous month up 03 percent after decembers 06 percent gain 
overall grocery prices were up 02 percent while restaurant 
meal costs climbed 03 percent after climbing sharply through the 
fall the index for fruits and vegetables fell 04 percent last 
month beef prices were down 14 percent pork prices fell 05 
percent 
poultry prices however climbed 10 percent while cereal and 
bakery products rose 11 percent 
although import prices have been rising recently under the 
pressure of a weaker us dollar the january price report did not 
show much evidence of dollarrelated inflation 
and despite the surge in service prices in january most 
economists stuck to their predictions of relatively little price 
acceleration for 1988 
there were a lot of price increases that come at the first of 
the year but im not overly alarmed said lawrence chimerine 
chairman of the wefa group a philadelphiaarea forecasting service 
services are clearly a major source of inflation but i think 
that in the months to come well see less inflation from services 
and more from import price increases chimerine added 
the labor department gave these other specifics of january price 
behavior 
new automobile prices were down 02 percent used automobile 
prices fell 01 percent 
housing expenses were up 04 percent 
apparel costs gained 01 percent 
tobacco products rose 28 percent 
januarys increase left the cpi at 1157 meaning that a 
selection of goods and services that cost 100 during a 198284 
base period cost would have 11570 last month 
the department recently abandoned a 1967 base period in favor of 
the 1982 standard under that earlier base period a selection of 
goods and services costing 100 in that year would have cost 
34670 last month which is 156 more than the same goods cost 
in january 1986 
the overall index is not adjusted for seasonal variations while 
other figures in the report are

soviet concerns about president reagans 
proposed spacebased missile defense system are diminishing 
possibly opening the door to wider testing of the star wars 
program than moscow previously said it could accept according to a 
report published today 
in what was described as a highly unusual luncheon in moscow 
with reporters a highranking soviet official said his country 
only opposed the deployment of the spacebased system and would 
want assurances that the united states would not use a testing 
program to disguise actual deployment 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said if 
they have new moves or new proposals we will certainly take a look 
at them 
the new york times said the soviet official spoke freely 
thursday during the meal of caviar and filet mignon with reporters 
on the condition he not be identified or quoted directly as senior 
american government officials often do 
the official said technical problems with the system made it 
unlikely a workable system could be produced by the end of the 
century 
he added that moscow remains committed to a strict 
interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty which 
includes prohibitions on the development of spacebased weapons 
envisioned under reagans strategic defense initiative 
it was unclear if the new position was a genuine change in 
soviet policy or merely a hint of possible compromise the times 
said 
a revised soviet position on testing of components of the system 
could alleviate one of the main obstacles to completion of a treaty 
reducing longrange strategic missiles

gov evan mechams chief attorney has 
resigned just days after other lawyers were brought in to handle 
the governors impeachment trial opening next week before the state 
senate 
murray miller said today during a brief interview at his office 
that the decision to withdraw from the case came thursday night he 
declined to elaborate on the decision but he said he hoped members 
of the senate would not suspect he had deceived them 
as late as wednesday night after his appearance before the 
senate i was fully in charge of the case and defending the 
governor miller said 
i feel uncomfortable that the impeachment court the senate 
may think i knew about the withdrawal at the time i appeared and 
that i was being deceptive i want them to be asssured that is 
totally not the case 
miller said he thought that washington attorney jerris leonard 
hired earlier this week by mecham to be the lead lawyer for the 
impeachment trial is now in charge of mechams case 
miller said he did not know whether the new mecham legal team 
would be able to proceed with the impeachment trial as scheduled 
monday but assumed they would if so ordered 
my main concern is that the governor gets a fair legal 
shake said miller 
another lawyer hired by mecham this week thomas crowe said 
today that leonard would be at the senate on monday 
how ready hell be i dont know but he will be there crowe 
said he also said the attorneys had not decided whether they would 
go to court today in an effort to delay the impeachment trial 
the arizona daily star of tucson today quoted the governor as 
saying murray withdrew from the case we parted friendly but 
thats really all youll have to ask him why 
mecham and leonard did not immediately return phone calls this 
morning 
leonard resigned from the washington law firm of manatt phelps 
rothenberg tunney and evans because of his decision to join 
mechams defense said charles t manatt a senior partner in the 
firm 
jerris leonard informed the firm last week that he had been 
contacted by governor mecham concerning representation manatt 
said we made it clear that the firm was not interested in 
representing governor mecham and mr leonard informed us that he 
has resigned from the firm 
manatt a former chairman of the democratic national committee 
was asked why his firm wasnt interested in being associated with 
the mecham case lots of reasons you can well imagine he 
replied 
miller said wednesday he did not know additional attorneys were 
being hired until leonard walked into his office monday 
the beleaguered mecham also faces a may 17 recall election and a 
march 22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan 
the senate on wednesday refused to delay the impeachment trial 
miller said then that he expected to remain the lead attorney until 
leonard could get acquainted with the case 
mecham hired miller on oct 21 the day it was disclosed that 
the attorney generals office was investigating mechams failure to 
disclose the 350000 campaign loan made in 1986 
on thursday miller filed a motion asking the state senate to 
dismiss the impeachment case 
lawyers in the case also raised the possibility that the 
governor would go to state or federal court today in an effort to 
delay the senate trial senate counsel john lundin told lawmakers 
he expected any challenge to be filed in the state supreme court 
if mechams attorneys ask a court to delay the trial the senate 
is expected to argue that courts have no jurisdiction over a 
legislative impeachment 
the motion filed thursday said this impeachment article 
should be dismissed and the governor should be permitted to govern 
this state as mandated by the will of the people in the last 
election 
miller has contended that the republican governors impeachment 
trial should be delayed until after his criminal trial on grounds 
that the criminal jury would be prejudiced by the publicity 
surrounding an impeachment trial 
mecham was impeached feb 5 on a 4616 house vote several days 
later the house approved 23 impeachment articles outlining details 
of three broad charges against the governor that he concealed the 
350000 campaign loan misused 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership and tried to 
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state 
official 
miller argued that the claim regarding the alleged death threat 
was a tempest in a teapot that had given the prosecutors the 
unbridled license to wildly charge crimes against the governor in a 
vindictive and persecutorial manner 
miller said mecham cannot be convicted for allegedly concealing 
the 350000 loan because a campaign financial report on which the 
loan was lumped with other funds was made on dec 5 1986 before 
mecham took office the state constitution says officials may be 
impeached only for acts committed while in office miller said 
miller said the 80000 loan to mecham pontiac violated no laws 
and was nothing short of a prudent investment that earned 
higher interest than the money would have gotten in a bank

a woman has reached a 925000 
settlement of her suit against a hospital and nursing company 
charging a nurse incorrectly hooked up a pump causing air pressure 
that blew a hole in the womans intestine

inc which supplied the nurse under a contract with the hospital 
mrs johns malpractice lawsuit had been scheduled to go to trial 
next week 
mrs johns was recovering from lung surgery at university 
hospital in jacksonville last year when her doctor ordered a tube 
placed down her throat to remove intestinal gas 
however a privateduty nurse attached the tube to the exhaust 
end of a pump and air was pumped into mrs johns blowing a hole in 
her intestines her lawyers said 
she realized something was wrong when because her stomach 
started blowing up like a balloon alford said of his client 
she suffered extreme pain at that point she ripped this thing 
out of her nose and out of her stomach and a doctor later said this 
ultimately saved her life 
mrs johns was rushed into surgery and was in intensive care for 
eight days 
under the agreement the hospital will pay 150000 and the 
nursing pool will pay 775000 said alford and fellow attorney 
john kalil the settlement was reached after a judge ruled that 
both the hospital and the nursing firm could be held liable

us ambassador arthur davis said the us government would not 
recognize the replacement for devalle who had acted to assert 
civilian control over the government 
opposition leaders were meeting today to discuss a possible 
national strike and the university was closed but banks and stores 
opened and there was no sign of unrest 
noriega under indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges said through his miami attorney ray takiff 
all american interest in the republic are and shall remain 
undisturbed and unharmed 
noriega said he was a friend of the american people but he 
denounced us politicans who he said advocate hysteria and act 
with a wreckless disregard for the truth 
in an interview broadcast today by the governments radio 
nacional noriega said of the united states they have been using 
a web that includes psychological warfare slander lies 
injury conjecture and misinformation 
drivers honked their horns and some waved white handerchiefs 
immediately after delvalle announced his plan to oust noriega both 
have been signs of opposition to noriega who was the target of 
nationwide protests and strikes last summer 
carlos ernesto gonzales de la lastra a spokesman for the 
opposition national civic crusade coalition said today in a 
telephone interview the national civic crusade and other 
opposition leaders are meeting to reach an agreement with the 
intention of carrying out a national strike he declined to give 
more details 
officials of the national university of panama closed the school 
and said it was to prevent disturbances secondary and primary 
schools were out for vacation 
delvalle called his own ouster something legally despicable 
that only fulfills a formality in the mind of those who want to 
grasp power at any cost 
he urged a trade embargo against panama but said he opposed us 
military intervention 
panama with 22 million people is headquarters for us 
military operations in latin america 
the us southern command has 10000 troops and 20000 
dependents in panama the us garrison was on alert and told 
americans to keep a low profile during any unrest 
the white house called for noriegas resignation after his 
indictment in florida on feb 5 delvalles attempt to oust 
noriega announced in a nationwide broadcast thursday night 
received immediate backing from the united states 
but noriega and his supporters moved quickly 
the national assembly was called into session although 
opposition lawmakers in the 67member legislature boycotted the 1 
am meeting both delvalle and vice president roderick esquivel 
were removed from office 
noriega who says he is innocent of all charges did not comment 
publicly on the events 
delvalle said of his opponents they will not receive 
acceptance from any country that takes pride in being democratic i 
continue to feel that i am president of the republic 
from his home delvalle said he asked noriega to retire as 
soon as the us indictments were announced but the general 
refused 
defense forces police chief col leonidas macias told panamanian 
television thursday that no officer would replace the general 
he delvalle is going first said macias flanked by senior 
officers at the defense forces central garrison 
delvalle said earlier that col marcos justines the chief of 
staff would replace noriega justines refused and told reporters 
we have been conversing with him delvalle constantly and he 
knows that our position has been that there is too much american 
interference in this panamanian affair 
in its resolution the national assembly said delvalle violated 
the law in removing noriega and noted that esquivel had abandoned 
his post in september without resigning 
the resolution said delvalle mentioned us charges against 
noriega with the object of permitting the intervention of the 
government of the united states in the internal affairs of 
panama damaging national sovereignty and endangering national 
security 
the us indictments accuse noriega of using his authority to 
let colombian drug traffickers use panama as a base for smuggling 
cocaine and marijuana into the united states the charges said 
noriega received a healthy kickback from drug profits 
later at his home the president told the associated press 
that he ordered noriegas dismissal for the health of this 
country 
roman catholic archbishop marcos gregorio mcgrath arrived at the 
house and pledged support for delvalle

a leading panamanian dissident said today that 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle knew in advance his effort to 
fire military strongman manuel antonio noriega would fail 
but jose i blandon a former close associate of noriegas said 
in an interview that delvalles bid to depose noriega was but one 
step in an 18point plan that is designed to lead to noriegas 
ouster within three weeks 
it is exactly what we thought was going to happen blandon 
said referring to delvalles attempt to replace noriega with the 
secondranking officer in panamas defense forces and noriegas 
decision to ignore the order 
early today the panamian legislature voted to remove delvalle 
from office and appointed a successor 
blandon said that he and about 10 other opposition leaders have 
joined with delvalle in putting together the plan over the last 
several weeks 
the next steps in the plan blandon said include rallying broad 
international support for delvalle a general strike in panama and 
they hope an embargo by the united states aimed at crippling 
panamas economy 
these steps blandon said will leave noriega more isolated 
than ever and force his eventual downfall 
blandon said his allies already have been in touch with 
authorities in the dominican republic to determine whether they 
would be willing to allow noriega to enter the country if and when 
he is forced out he said dominican officials have responded 
positively to the proposal 
one potential obstacle to noriegas acquiescence to this 
solution is the possibility of his arrest in the dominican republic 
and his extradition to the united states based on federal drug 
smuggling indictments against him blandon said 
he said delvalle raised last week with assistant secretary of 
state elliott abrams the possibility of dropping the us 
indictments against noriega he said abrams was unable to make any 
such commitment and that a final decision on withdrawing the 
indictments would have to be left either to the justice department 
or president reagan 
in any case blandon said the political and economic 
circumstances in panama are such that it is doubtful that noriega 
can survive much longer especially if the united states and latin 
american countries close ranks behind delvalle 
blandon spoke to a reporter at a local hotel where he is under 
24hour guard by us marshals he was a key witness earlier this 
month in congressional hearings on noriegas alleged drug smuggling 
activities and his ties to the cia 
as he spoke blandon frequently referred to a folder outlining 
the plan to end noriegas domination of panamanian politics and to 
restore elected civilian rule to the country the plan was dated 
feb 22 but its contents had been agreed to weeks earlier by a 
broadbased coalition of panamanian opposition leaders blandon 
said

an abandoned rum warehouse has become 
the latest symbol of rebirth in this port city that was founded on 
cotton famed for its beatles and devastated by changing times 
contractors on wednesday handed over the keys of the old 
warehouse to sir alan bowness director of londons tate gallery 
on may 24 prince charles the heir to the throne will come to 
the building and open the tate in the north the first endeavor 
by a state museum in britain to show its works on a large scale 
outside of london 
a series of 10month exhibitions will keep pictures and 
sculpture circulating to liverpool from the tates collection of 
40000 works of british and 20th century art 
it is a bid to attract another 500000 visitors a year to 
liverpool 
first to be seen will be surrealist art the works of american 
abstract painter mark rothko and british sculpture of the past 20 
years 
liverpool has had a hard time and its trying to pull itself 
up i hope we can help not least because ive always felt it was 
unacceptable that the tate should only be in london bowness told 
the associated press 
it will cost about 176 million to convert a warehouse in the 
albert dock completed in 1846 to a museum the dock contains five 
blocks of fivestory redbrick and castiron warehouses 
surrounding a 7acre courtyard of water 
the dock area already has a maritime museum and shops more 
shops restaurants and apartments are being created in the 
warehouses which have been empty since world war ii when the dock 
fell into disuse 
now the dock buildings are considered so valuable as 
architectural history that they are stateprotected and liverpool 
waterfront stretching 1 miles along the banks of the 
onemilewide mersey river is being transformed from dereliction 
into a major tourist area 
more than 50 million pounds 88 million has already been 
sunk into the waterfront and we are sure it is going to be a 
spectacular success said diana day publicist for the merseyside 
development corp 
private industry has invested more than 315 million in other 
liverpool projects 
liverpool with 600000 people 210 miles northwest of london is 
beset by 20 percent unemployment and miles of decaying housing 
fifteen million people live within one hours drive from the city 
which was home to the rock group the beatles 
liverpool was once the second port in britain after london and 
the major port of europe for the atlantic said eric 
leatherbarrow spokesman for mersey docks and harbor co 
but when britain joined the european economic community trade 
tilted from here to southeast england and containerization saw a 
lot of the old shipping lines disappear 
now we are pulling up because european businessmen are 
realizing that liverpool is still the nearest major port to the 
united states shipping companies are coming back and our cargo 
throughput was up by 1 million tons a year to 11 million tons in 
1987 
to generate interest for the new museum the tate in the 
north has prepared charming and funny posters introducing 
liverpudlians to the world of modern art 
one radio commercial features picassos three dancers 
a male voice explains the painting as follows 
the bloke on the right was married to the woman on the left 
who was having an affair with the bloke in the middle who was 
obsessed with her only she lost interest so he invited her to a 
restaurant with some friends they have a slapup dinner then he 
pulls a gun fires at her she ducks plays doggo then he shot 
himself 
when his mother heard she died of shock you see paintings 
talk to you 
i dont hear nothing a second voice replies

leaders of the assemblies of god said 
today they have asked church officials in louisiana to reconsider a 
recommended threemonth suspension for fallen tv evangelist jimmy 
swaggart that hundreds of callers criticized as too lenient 
twelve members of the churchs highest governing board met for 
12 hours at the churchs international headquarters in springfield 
today and thursday to discuss the louisiana districts proposed 
sanctions against swaggart who allegedly engaged in voyeurism with 
a prostitute 
officials of swaggarts home district recommended earlier this 
week that the fiery television evangelist who confessed to 
undisclosed moral misconduct be prohibited from preaching for 
three months and undergo two years of rehabilitation and counseling 
the state recommendation was criticized by many church members 
as too lenient and the executive presbyterys move today was an 
indication the board disagreed with the state districts 
recommendation 
meanwhile the companion of a prostitute who claims she 
performed pornographic acts for swaggart for about a year said he 
was negotiating to sell her story to the mass media 
this is a shot for me and a shot for her said john 
martinez a carpet cleaner who said he met debra murphree 28 in 
west palm beach fla about four months ago its the american 
way see an opportunity and jump on it 
martinez said he discussed a 100000 contract to tell ms 
murphree story with the national enquirer and also contacted 
people magazine abctvs nightline and other media worldwide the 
palm beach post reported thursday 
enquirer president and editor iain calder confirmed the tabloid 
was talking with martinez but would say nothing more 
at the end of the assemblies of god meeting here general 
superintendent g raymond carlson said we will not discuss the 
content of our meeting he said no final decision had been 
reached on swaggarts punishment and it could be several weeks 
until one is made 
the church constitution provides for the louisiana district to 
reconsider the case and submit new recommendations to the church 
headquarters in springfield where the final decision will be made 
carlson made the announcement with seven board members at his 
side 
juleen turnage a church spokeswoman said the board met 
thursday with two representatives of the churchs louisiana 
district cecil janway general superintendent of the state 
district and a member of the swaggart ministries board and forrest 
hall treasurer of the louisiana district 
swaggart who was not at thursdays meeting has not made a 
public appearance since sunday when he tearfully told his 
congregation in baton rouge la that he had committed an 
unspecified sin 
the evangelist whose jimmy swaggart world ministries gives 12 
million a year to the assemblies of god has been known for his 
harsh denunciation of sexual lapses by other preachers including 
ptl ministry founder jim bakker 
the churchs 13member governing body was considering a 
recommendation by the louisiana district that swaggart be barred 
from preaching for three months and undergo counseling during a 
supervised twoyear rehabilitation 
mrs turnage said the international headquarters here has been 
swamped with up to 300 calls an hour since swaggarts televised 
confession sunday about half of the callers complained that the 
louisiana recommendation was too lenient she said while others 
were generally supportive 
mrs turnage said the twoyear rehabilitation is standard but 
in cases of moral misconduct on the part of ministers the 
precedent has always been that for that first year the minister is 
barred from preaching 
under the church constitution if the executive presbytery 
decides to toughen up the state districts recommendation they 
would send the case back to louisiana for reconsideration 
the group had no statement after the meeting thursday but mrs 
turnage said they may release a progress report after more 
discussion today 
we cannot put time and expediency ahead of our constitutional 
process she said i know that they are really carefully 
considering everything 
the church the nations largest pentecostal denomination has 
been shaken by the swaggart revelations and a sexandmoney scandal 
that last year cost bakker another prominent assemblies minister 
his ministerial credentials he had rejected the option of 
undergoing rehabilitation 
evangelist marvin gorman who claimed swaggart falsely accused 
him of adultery for which he was defrocked by the denomination 
reportedly gave the church photographs of swaggart entering and 
leaving a motel room with a prostitute 
ms murphree told wvuetv of new orleans wednesday that she met 
with swaggart for about a year at various motels between new 
orleans and baton rouge to perform pornographic acts but did not 
have sexual intercourse with him 
ms murphree has an arrest record in louisiana and florida for 
prostitutionrelated offenses she also is wanted on a drug charge 
in nashville tenn according to police records

eric arturo delvalle today insisted 
he is still president of panama and called for a worldwide trade 
embargo against his nation and its de factor ruler gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
delvalle ousted by the national assembly today after he tried 
to fire noriega said a trade embargo would create economic chaos 
but we all have to realize that a country has to suffer to rid 
itself of a dictatorship 
he said he also he also supports us congressional calls for a 
halt to commercial airline flights and to freezone banking 
transactions between the united states and panama home of one of 
the western hemispheres largest banking centers 
delvalle spoke informally to reporters at his home where he has 
remained since he announced thursday afternoon he was firing 
noriega 
the assembly is dominated by a coalition of noriegas supporters 
and its brief postmidnight session was boycotted by minority 
opposition members 
i am the president of panama this morning delvalle 
declared his eyes baggy and redrimmed from lack of sleep there 
is no doubt about it there is no legal power in panamanian laws or 
the constitution that allows the national assembly to dismiss a 
president 
but asked how he intended to exercise the functions of the 
presidency delvalle shrugged and replied with a tired smile 
thats a good question 
he said he knew that his chances were slim in calling for 
noriegas departure because never has any president ousted the 
commander of the defense forces in panama in all our history it 
has always been the other way around 
delvalle said he would take his case to the nations supreme 
court where my chances are also very slim because it also is 
controlled by gen noriega 
the cabinet named education minister manuel solis palma as the 
new chief of state 
meanwhile a coalition of business professional labor and 
political organization known as the national civic crusade was 
meeting to consider a call for a nationwide work stoppage 
delvalle said he would support an indefinite strike and 
called the people of panama to unite all for one and one for 
all to struggle for the removal of gen noriega 
he said that as soon as us grand jury indictments charging 
noriega with drug trafficking were announced in miami and tampa 
fla earlier this month he called noriega and asked him to step 
down 
but he said he didnt think it was advisable 
i let him consider his answer for a couple of days and then 
again i requested his own decision to retire which he didnt 
accept and thats why i acted today thursday 
in a telephone interview with cbs this morning delvalle 
said the united states had not pressured him to fire noriega 
delvalle 51 spent most of the evening huddled in a back room 
with us ambassador arthur davis and his personal advisers 
between 30 and 40 people most of them close friends listened 
to radio and television news reports at the delvalle home and he 
occasionally strolled out to chat with them 
asked about the naming of another president delvalle replied 
i will fight it out because there is no reason for me to be 
removed from my position i am acting within the laws and the 
constistution of the country 
asked what reaction he expected from the international 
community delvalle said the reaction of the international 
community will be against the defense forces 
asked if he had discussed thursdays action with us assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams while in miami last week 
delvalle said no not at all 
but delvalle said he had a fourhour visit from davis thursday 
evening and received state department support stating that 
they will back me and support my actions 
he said he did not fear for his safety 
delvalle had no political experience before he became vice 
president in october 1984 after running for the republic party in 
a coalition with five other parties 
he was president and general manager of national sugar a sugar 
producing and refining company owned by his family he studied in 
the united states 
he and his wife mariela diaz have three children

taxpayers who underestimated their incometax 
withholding this year would be allowed to pay the internal revenue 
service in installments under legislation introduced friday in the 
senate 
sen carl levin dmich said broad changes in the income tax 
law passed in 1986 make it more likely that taxpayers especially 
in families with two wageearners failed to deduct enough from 
their paychecks to cover their tax liabilities 
the bill sponsored by levin and sen steve symms ridaho 
would allow people who underwithheld to pay off their debt to the 
irs with interest in three payments after april 15 
under the present law taxpayers unable to pay a lump sum by 
april 15 must negotiate terms with the irs on a casebycase basis

a top socialist minister today reversed 
his decision to boycott a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of 
nazi germanys annexation of austria after president kurt waldheim 
dropped plans to speak during the event 
other socialists hailed the decision of the president who 
served as a lieutenant in the german army during world war ii 
in a televised interview thursday waldheim announced he would 
not give a speech march 11 he said he would give a televised 
speech march 10 
in the interview waldheim also said he had considered quitting 
the presidency but had rejected the idea 
the announcement on the speech prompted finance minister 
ferdinand lacina to reverse his decision to boycott the solemn 
ceremony 
lacina a socialist said friday that a waldheim speech would 
have led to a renewed polarization among austrians and 
criticism coming from other countries 
heinz fischer a leader of the socialist party said waldheims 
decision to drop the speech will lead to an easing of tensions on 
march 11 
waldheim has been surrounded by controversy since march 1986 
when it was disclosed that he had served as a lieutenant with the 
german army in the balkans during world war ii the united states 
and put him on a watch list of undesirable aliens barring him 
from entering the united states 
in the interview thursday waldheim said he had a clear 
conscience and repeatedly insisted he did nothing wrong 
austria is governed by a coalition of socialists and 
conservatives waldheim is the ceremonial head of state 
the head of the government chancellor franz vranitzky told 
abctvs good morning america today that it was up to waldheim 
to determine whether he should step down 
the 69yearold waldheim said he will address the nation in a 
televised broadcast on march 10 the eve of the ceremony marking 
the anschluss when austria was absorbed into the german reich in 
1938 austria was liberated by the allies in the spring of 1945 
waldheim opponents had promised to take to the streets in 
protest if the president went ahead with the talk on march 11 in 
the hofburg palace 
several leading austrian politicians said a waldheim speech was 
not the way to lead the country into reflecting on its nazi past 
there have been calls for waldheims resignation since march 
1986 when austrian and us media and the world jewish congress 
reported that he served as a lieutenant with the germany army in 
the occupied balkans during world war ii 
the calls intensified after an international historians 
commission issued a critical report earlier this month which left 
open the question of whether he was guilty of war crimes 
if i thought i had done anything false or anything wrong then 
i would have taken the consequences waldheim said 
in the controversy over waldheims past taking the 
consequences has come to be synonymous with resignation 
waldheims term is scheduled to end in 1992 
waldheim was asked if he had considered quitting 
naturally i thought of it he said otherwise i wouldnt 
be a human being id have to be a piece of wood 
but he firmly rejected any notion of stepping down my 
resignation would only make things worse he said 
waldheims decision not to speak at the anschluss commemoration 
dominated the front pages of newspapers today 
waldheim cancels the speech at the remembrance ceremony 
said the salzburger nachrichten the conservative newspaper has 
strongly criticized waldheim for his handling of his wartime past 
viennas kurier tabloid which also has criticized waldheim 
focused on conciliatory remarks he made in the interview 
waldheim i apologize for the misunderstandings the kurier 
newspaper said in a banner headline 
the march 11 speech originally had been planned as a way to 
avoid a political showdown over whether waldheim would address a 
joint session of parliament to mark anschluss

a woman with two small children who is 
running for election to a judgeship says shes surprised her 
opponent has made motherhood an issue in their campaign 
district judge john mckellips raised the issue at a sheriffs 
deputies meeting while comparing his qualifications with mary anne 
brambletts 
bramblett an assistant county attorney has less than six years 
experience as a lawyer and is seeking to become the countys first 
female state judge because there is no republican candidate the 
winner of their march 8 democratic primary will capture the 41st 
district judges seat 
the incumbent judge suggested bramblett and other mothers should 
stay home with their young children 
she had to take some time out for maternity leave to have two 
small children so i dont know how much time shes actually spent 
working as an attorney he added wednesday night 
the judge also linked absent mothers to the problem of 
overcrowded jails and prisons 
what do we do about crowded prisons well we can start in 
our homes he said mothers can stay home and raise their 
children during the formative years 
the judge continued the theme thursday in an interview with the 
el paso times 
no one who will be truthful will deny the importance of a 
mother being with children during preschool years he said 
other persons may try to substitute and mean well but theres no 
substitute for a mothers love 
the judges views were surprising bramblett said 
everybody got the clear message that mckellips believes i am 
not qualified to be a judge because im a woman and a mother 
said bramblett whose children are 3 and 4 years old 
the judges comments to the sheriffs deputies association were 
made in the context of crime rates and the cause of crime he said 
i acknowledge it would have been more correct to have used the 
term parent rather than mother he said in the thursday 
interview the whole point of this discussion is a breakdown of 
parental guidance in the home whether that breakdown is the fault 
of the mother or the father 
he said as a district judge one never has a normal life to 
do your job properly requires long hours and extra devotion and 
she would have less time as a judge to be with her family than she 
has had in the past it appears that mrs brambletts personal 
ambitions are more important to her than the lives of her 
children 
its not true bramblett said i think my children have a 
very good role model to look up to both myself and my husband

as one of a great deal of political maneuvering 
she said delvalles decision to fire manuel antonio noriega as 
the nations defense chief which precipated delvalles ouster by 
the assembly took great courage and we continue with our 
policy

pat robertson complains that he is being held 
to a higher standard than his rivals but the political world is in 
awe over how he gets away with controversial statements that would 
sink other presidential hopefuls 
the man is tefloned says republican consultant ed mahe 
he is tefloned so well with his base that hes not taking any 
hits as a consequence of what he says 
but mahe and other experts say robertsons controversial 
pronouncements are likely to sink whatever hopes he holds of 
winning over enough mainstream support in the republican party to 
be a serious contender for the presidential nomination at the gop 
convention in august 
ultimately this could be his upending said sociologist 
anson shupe of indiana coauthor of a forthcoming book 
televangelism power and politics in gods country 
if robertson doesnt make it to the nomination it wont be 
because of a lack of money or grassroots organization or definable 
issues or momentum it will be because he is so far out in left 
field with some of these statements that even his followers are 
embarrassed shupe said 
even ronald reagan who has often stood corrected ridiculed 
robertsons claim that his christian broadcasting network had 
information about the location of hostages in the middle east 
isnt it strange that no one in our administration was ever 
apprised of that asked the president at his news conference 
wednesday in a departure from his loyalty to the republican 11th 
commandment speak no evil of any republican 
robertson said his hostage claim was only a throwaway line 
to illustrate a point but he complained wherever he went that he 
is being held to an unfair scrutiny 
i have been grossly misunderstood and the press has distorted 
what ive said he said in tulsa okla 
i dont go around with a press person on one side and a lawyer 
on another and a librarian behind me robertson said im not 
used to having to give 200 answers every time theres one little 
innocent statement 
exactly right mahe said what we have here is a talkshow 
host who doesnt understand the power of talk after all when 
youre a talkshow host you toss these things out and who cares 
my guess is that pat is deliberately playing to his south 
carolina constituency said university of virginia sociologist 
jeffrey hadden a student of the television fundamentalist 
preachers he doesnt care if folks in new york or chicago or los 
angeles think hes crazy at this point if he can get the press 
bashing him a bit it would help ignite his followers 
just as robertson weathered the hostage crisis this week he 
survived the missile crisis earlier this month 
when he claimed there were soviet missiles in cuba the pentagon 
denied it the white house denied it even fidel castro denied it 
and robertson merely shrugged off the outcry saying he hoped those 
doing the denying were right 
he also suggested he saw the sinister hand of vice president 
george bush behind the timing of the disclosures of sexual 
misbehavior by a fellow fundamentalist preacher jimmy swaggart 
and he accused television anchorman tom brokaw of engaging in 
religious bigotry when brokaw referred to robertson a former 
television evangelist as a former television evangelist 
bush challenged robertson on friday to prove it about his 
claim that bush engineered the timing of the swaggart disclosures 
to hurt robertsons chances in the march 5 south carolina primary 
and the vice president said robertson is scaring the american 
people with loose talk about missiles 
stephen hess a brookings institution student of the press and 
politics said robertsons ability to weather attacks on his 
credibility the teflon factor exists because the press has 
been easy on him 
the media gets tough on people when they become important 
he said 
moreover said larry sabato a political scientist at the 
university of virginia who has followed robertson for decades 
the other republican candidates are hesitant to attack him even 
bush has done so gingerly the republicans know they need his 
constituency in the fall they know these people are easily 
offended and will stay permanently offended

the nations roman catholic bishops on 
friday said time was running out for communist authorities to bring 
sweeping economic and political reforms to poland 
among the reforms they called for are constitutional guarantees 
for private enterprise and the right of workers to form independent 
trade unions 
the bishops also said they viewed with seriousness and 
concern the impact of price hikes imposed by the government 
earlier this month they said authorities must protect pensioners 
invalids and poor families from further impoverishment 
the bishops made their remarks in a communique released after a 
twoday meeting of the polish episcopate in warsaw presided over by 
the polish primate cardinal jozef glemp 
the communique reflected growing concern within the influential 
church about the authorities slow pace in introducing political 
and economic reforms announced last fall 
the bishops quoted extensively from the recent encyclical issued 
by pope john paul ii on social action 
they cited passages saying that the development and wellbeing 
of nations depends on guaranteeing the right to undertake economic 
initiatives at the expense of bureaucratic state apparatuses 
respecting human rights including the freedom to set up trade 
unions and reforming unjust political institutions 
glemp in a pastoral letter read aloud in the nations churches 
feb 21 said the many shortcomings in polands economic system 
had embittered and discouraged people while the governments 
economic recovery program seemed incomprehensible and 
inconsistent to many poles 
the bishops said there had been many official announcements 
about introducing reforms aimed at allowing more political and 
economic initiatives but they had remained in the sphere of 
declarations and discussions 
administrative practice often goes in the opposite direction 
setting a dam for various economic and social initiatives the 
bishops said time is running out 
it is only acts that can convince the society about the real 
wish of reforms in the economic social and political life they 
said without them there is a danger of deepening the crisis in 
our country 
the bishops said the authorities should make it easier for 
individuals to set up their own businesses grant more economic 
decisionmaking powers to local governments and reject political 
criteria in the selection of managerial personnel 
it is necessary to widen the role of the private sector in the 
national economy the bishops said 
they added that the economic reforms should be accompanied by 
wide reforms allowing the society to organize independent 
social associations and workers representations 
the government has said its political and economic reform 
programs advocate many of the same goals supported by the bishops 
the outlawed solidarity labor union has called the reforms 
inadequate because they fail to loosen the communist partys grip 
on economic and political decisionmaking powers

president reagan said today the united states 
does not plan any military intervention in panama and the state 
department reaffirmed us support for that nations embattled 
president 
at the white house reagan was asked about the governmental 
crisis in panama where president eric arturo delvalle failed in 
his attempt to oust gen manuel antonio noriega the countrys 
strongman and was in turn dismissed himself 
there are some limits on what we can do but we are looking at 
the situation to see if there is anything we can do the 
president said 
when asked if military intervention was planned he said no 
i dont think thats the answer 
we are not prepared to come up with any answer yet reagan 
added 
when he was asked whether he thought the 10000 or so us 
troops in panama were in danger the president replied no i do 
not i dont think there is any appetite on the part of anyone 
there including mr noriega to take on our troops 
separately the state department said it continues to recognize 
devalle as panamas president despite an earlymorning 
parliamentary vote to oust him 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley reiterated what she termed 
our support for the supremacy of civilian constitutiona rule 
and said we continue to recognize president delvalle as the 
president 
asked to describe the legal grounds for such recognition she 
said i dont think its for us to interpret their constitutional 
law we had regarded him as the president we still regard him as 
the president 
in other developments 
panamas ambassador to the united states juan sosa an ally of 
delvalle said he had informed the state department he would stay 
on at least for the time being despite a call from noriega 
telling sosa he would be replaced 
mrs oakley said the united states does indeed continue to 
recognize sosa 
vice president george bush said in south carolina that the 
united states should do whatever is necessary including military 
force to protect american interests 
bush stopped short of calling for military intervention saying 
the united states history of intervention in latin american 
affairs is whats hurting us in some areas now 
during a presidential campaign visit to south carolina he said 
we will do whatever is necessary to protect american interests in 
panama weve got treaty interests on the panama canal i dont 
want to rattle any sabers 
defense secretary frank carlucci interviewed on a us 
information agency program also said that it would be premature 
at this time to discuss an american military move 
jose i blandon a former noriega ally but now a leading 
panamanian dissident predicted that noriega would be out of power 
within three weeks and said delvalles allies have already asked 
the dominican republic if it would let noriega live there if and 
when he is forced out 
he said dominican officials have responded positively to the 
proposal 
reagan said the united states did not instigate delvalles 
action but had been very much aware of it 
when asked whether the united states still wants noriega to 
stand trial on drug trafficking charges on which he was indicted by 
a federal grand jury in miami the president said i assume so 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier that 
delvalle had consulted with american officials at the us embassy 
in panama city 
we have had discussions with delvalle over the past several 
days we assured him of our position which is that we would like 
to see a peaceful transition to civilian rule the spokesman said 
asked whether the united states had encouraged delvalle to 
dismiss noriega who has been indicted by a federal grand jury in 
this country on charges of drug trafficking presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater replied 
i cant elaborate on any of the specific conversations we did 
not urge him to take this action he did it on his own 
we have a precarious position yes we want him noriega to 
stand trial yes we want a civilian government in panama yet we 
want to be careful not to unduly intrude upon the affairs of 
panama 
another us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the united states would take steps if americans are endangered 
in panama 
meanwhile sen jesse helms rnc a leading noriega critic 
said panamanians will take care of that themselves just wait 
and see what happens if and when the united states takes a 
flatfooted stand and tells the panamanian president were with you 
and were against him helms said 
he said of noreiga hes a bum he ought to be thrown out 
sen alfonse damato rny proposed a trade embargo against 
the government under the control of military strongman manuel 
noriega and called for us troops to be put on full alert to 
protect the panama canal and 50000 us citizens in the country 
fitzwater said no consideration is being given to a trade 
embargo 
delvalle in a telephone interview with cbs this morning 
indicated he still considers himself president and urged a us 
trade embargo against his country as the only way that we can get 
rid of the dictators of the americas but said he saw no reason 
for military intervention 
the reagan administration on thursday voiced unqualified 
support for civilian constitutional rule in panama after delvalle 
tried to fire noriega as military chief

george bush said friday that republican 
presidential rival pat robertson should produce evidence to back up 
rash allegations that the vice president said were scaring the 
american people 
bush in a forceful response to the former television 
evangelist recounted several allegations that robertson has made 
against bush and his republican presidential campaign 
of each he demanded prove it 
bush made the remarks in an address to state newspaper editors 
he was less direct about robertson moments later in a private 
meeting with about two dozen fundamentalist church leaders but told 
them i believe in jesus christ as my personal savior 
i dont like to feel theres a monolith out there that will 
back just one candidate for president he said 
bush and robertson have both targeted south carolina as a 
crucial battleground in their white house bids with robertson 
saying he must win the march 5 primary 
a group of 21 congressmen supporting bush flew into south 
carolina to spend the day campaigning for him as the vice president 
departed for atlanta after a twoday campaign swing here appearing 
with the congressmen who donned white baseballstyle caps bearing 
the words bush 88 the vice president said these guys can 
talk southern 
south carolina holds its gop primary just three days before the 
rest of the south votes and bush forces hope a win here will be a 
indicator of the super tuesday vote that follows when onethird of 
the gop delegates are at stake 
answering questions from the south carolina press association 
bush was asked about robertsons charges in the state earlier in 
the week that the bush campaign had engaged in sleazy 
campaigning and dirty tricks against the robertson campaign he 
also was asked about robertsons suggestion that bush aides 
engineered the release of information about the sex scandal 
involving evangelist jimmy swaggart to embarrass robertson 
no bush said if you make such an allegation the 
american sense of fair play says prove it 
i have something to do with arranging for the assembly of god 
church to bring out information two weeks before the south 
carolina primary bush asked referring to the swaggart charge 
forgive me prove it thats all i say 
bush asked why his questioner was smiling saying the nature of 
the allegations by robertson were serious in recounting them bush 
included robertsons claim in a debate in new hampshire two weeks 
ago that nuclear missiles are hidden in cuba 
if you think theres cuban missiles scaring the american 
people whats your facts bush said 
he also cited robertsons claim in backing out of a debate in 
dallas last week that questions had been leaked in advance and the 
audience was stacked against him prove it bush said 
bush told the church leaders he had respect for life and had 
been frustrated by the administrations lack of success in 
supporting prayer in public schools 
i know were pluralistic i also know were one nation under 
god i feel strongly about that bush said i would not be 
afraid of asking gods help 
before the editors bush cited the developments in panama and 
said the united states would use military force if necessary to 
protect us interests in panama following strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriegas removal of the nations president 
noriegas gone bad and hes proven hes trafficked in 
narcotics bush said noriega should go and in my view he 
will go 
bush referred to the american hostages in lebanon and said a 
problem in helping recover them has been that many of our sources 
in lebanon dried up because of the excessive publicity and 
exposure of the cia in the 1970s thats hurt us very very 
badly the former cia director said

ruins and across the ancient citys unexcavated necropolis 
carlo vizzini whose ministry protects and preserves 
archaeological sites said thursday that in no case will he 
approve a project that not only edges but minimally touches 
excavations at pompeii 
some members of pompeiis city government proposed reducing 
traffic congestion in the modern city by linking two existing

politicians said friday that kurt 
waldheims decision not to address the main ceremony will ease 
tensions when austria marks the 50th anniversary of the anschluss 
that made it part of nazi germany 
two socialist members of the cabinet had said they wouldnt 
attend the ceremony march ll and two others said they also might 
stay away if the president spoke 
socialist party leaders have said it would be inappropriate for 
waldheim who faces unresolved accusations of war crimes to lead 
the nation in remembering atrocities of the nazi past the party is 
the senior partner in austrias governing coalition 
waldheim announced thursday that he was canceling the speech 
and said in a television interview later i thought that with 
this decision which was my own initiative i might add i would 
contribute to the orderly carrying out of the solemn ceremony 
heinz fischer socialist floor leader in parliament said friday 
that waldheims decision will lead to an easing of tension on 
march 11 and it certainly was the most reasonable thing to do 
finance minister ferdinand lacina also a socialist withdrew 
his decision to boycott the march 11 ceremony 
in the television interview waldheim repeated his intention to 
remain in the presidency which is largely ceremonial and insisted 
that resigning would make matters worse 
he also repeated criticism of a report on his wartime activities 
by an international panel of historians declaring it full of 
contradictions and errneous presumptions 
waldhim concealed his world war ii service as a german army 
lieutenant in the balkans until accusations arose during the 
presidential campaign in 1986 that he had committed war crimes 
the united states put the former un secretarygeneral on a 
watch list of undesirable aliens last year and in september 
the government appointed the historians at waldheims request 
they said in their report this month that waldheim was in 
close proximity to atrocities knew of them and did not try to 
prevent them the historians said they found no proof that he 
committed war crimes but left the question of personal guilt open

cox died of natural causes thursday night at his home here a 
family spokesman said 
he was a real colorful and effectivetype judge who was his

during a hearing on a voter discrimination suit in 1964 cox 
said i dont know who is telling these negroes they can push 
people around just by getting into a line and acting like a bunch 
of chimpanzees

never was an impeachment proceeding

cuban immigrants who commit crimes in the united 
states can be shipped back to their homeland even if they have 
obtained us citizenship a top immigration and naturalization 
service official said 
the uscuban immigration agreement reached in november does 
not limit those eligible for deportation to the 2500 cuban 
detainees in federal prisons ins commissioner alan nelson said 
thursday 
his comments appeared in fridays editions of the miami herald 
nelson attended an academic conference in washington dc 
examining the 1980 mariel boatlift of cubans to the united states 
and the status of cuban detainees in us prisons 
any cuban who commits a crime whether he is a resident or 
citizen of the united states and if the law so sees fit can be 
deported nelson said 
advocates for cuban prisoners immediately criticized nelsons 
statements 
cuban deportation and what nelson is doing representing the 
governments politics is scandalous and truly unjustifiable 
said steven donziger a member of the cuban detainees support 
coalition in atlanta 
the immigration pact with cuba allows the deportation of 2500 
mariel detainees who have committed crimes in the united states in 
turn the united states agreed to allow about 20000 cubans and 
3000 political prisoners to immigrate every year 
news of the agreement triggered riots by cuban detainees at 
prisons in atlanta and oakdale la 
the pact was aimed at normalizing immigration nelson said 
there would be no purpose in sending 2500 refugees back now 
and not be able to deport anyone else in the future for committing 
crimes he said

the widow of challenger astronaut michael 
smith cannot sue the government for 15 billion in damages because 
her husband was on military duty when the space shuttle exploded 
killing him and six others a federal judge has ruled 
us district judge patricia fawsett cited earlier court 
decisions holding that military personnel or their dependents could 
not sue the government for injury or death while on active service 
smith the challengers pilot was a navy captain who was 
assigned to nasa in 1981 
smiths death occurred during activity incident to his 
military service the judge said in removing the federal 
government as a defendant in the suit filed by jane j smith 
the judge also agreed with government lawyers who argued that 
military personnel receive generous statutory veterans 
disability and death benefits 
mrs smiths lawyers had argued that her husband was not on 
regular military assignment and had no military duties at the time 
of his death 
the order filed this week in us district court in orlando 
maintained morton thiokol inc as the principal defendant in the 
civil lawsuit morton thiokol built the solidfuel booster rocket 
blamed for the explosion that destroyed the space shuttle on 
liftoff at cape canaveral on jan 28 1986 
the shuttle fleet has been grounded since then 
the families of the other six victims have accepted financial 
settlements four from morton thiokol and the government and two 
from morton thiokol alone 
ms fawsett also dismissed one count in the smith lawsuit 
seeking to bar morton thiokol from supplying nasa with any other 
booster rockets the court she said had no jurisdiction in any of 
the counts involving the federal government 
in a separate action on thursday the judge denied a request by 
mrs smith and her attorneys to transfer her lawsuit from orlando 
to the federal court in richmond va the judge did not explain the 
order 
mrs smith had sought to move the case because of a heavy 
caseload in the court system here and because she now lives in 
virginia beach va 
kerry nesbit a spokeswoman for mrs smiths lawyer william f 
maready said the lawyer was considering appealing the judges 
order monday dismissing the federal government from the lawsuit 
another defendant named in the smith lawsuit is lawrence b 
mulloy manager of nasas solid booster rocket program at marshall 
space flight center at the time of the challenger disaster federal 
attorneys have filed a motion seeking his removal from the case 
but ms fawsett has issued no decision 
us justice department spokeswoman amy brown said the 
government contends that mulloy was acting in an official capacity 
for an agency of the government and therefore cannot be sued

five wild cougars or mountain lions 
from texas will be released in a forest in northeastern florida to 
see if the closely related but endangered florida panther can 
survive there wildlife officials said friday 
if the reintroduction plan succeeds the florida panther could 
be roaming the osceola national forest by the next decade they 
said 
the big cats will be fitted and radio collars and sterilized 
before they are released in april or may in the forest north of 
lake city said tom logan chief of the bureau of wildlife research 
for the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
the osceola national forest was selected because of its size 
habitat and food base the surviving population of florida panthers 
now is largely confined to southern florida in the everglades and 
big cypress national preserve although sightings have been 
reported around lake okeechobee and inland from cape canaveral 
it is impossible to use florida panthers for the first phases of 
the project because only a few dozen of them survive logan said 
we dont have enough to experiment with logan said 
after the oneyear experiment the five cougars will be removed 
from the area and the second phase of the project will begin with 
the release of captiveborn cougars or hybrid offspring of a 
florida panther and a cougar 
so far attempts to mate big guy a florida panther injured 
several years ago by a car with female cougars at white oak 
plantation near yulee have been unsuccessful 
hes more aggressive than in past years we have our fingers 
crossed said chris belden an official with the panther project 
if the first two phases of the project are successful the final 
phase would be the introduction of florida panthers into the area 
each phase of the proposed experiment is structured to enable 
us to identify and deal with any problems that might come up and 
the radio collars would enable us to locate and remove any of the 
cats at any time we believe is necessary logan said 
the plan calls for livestock owners to be paid for any losses 
caused by the cats 
wildlife officials said they plan no special hunting season 
restrictions for the benefit of the cats but said it is unlikely 
that people will ever see the animals 
they are very reclusive animals and the likelihood of 
interaction is very very slim said logan

justice anthony m kennedy will not take part 
in the supreme courts deliberations on the constitutionality of a 
federal law authorizing independent counsels to investigate alleged 
crimes by government officials a court spokeswoman said friday 
spokeswoman toni house said kennedy who joined the court on 
feb 18 removed himself from consideration of the case without 
stating a reason 
his absence creates the possibility of a 44 tie when the 
courts ruling expected by july is announced 
if that occurs the deadlock would have the effect of nullifying 
the law because it would uphold a decision by the us circuit 
court of appeals here that declared the statute unconstitutional 
last month 
the appeals court struck down the watergateera law on grounds 
that it gives presidential appointment power to the federal courts 
the law authorizes a federal court to appoint a special prosecutor 
when the attorney general recommends an independent investigation 
of a highranking official accused of a crime 
the supreme court will hear arguments in the case april 26 in an 
appeal by independent counsel alexia morrison who is investigating 
former justice department official theodore b olson on charges he 
lied to congress 
the perjury conviction of former white house aide michael k 
deaver also could stand or fall depending on the court ruling 
kennedys decision not to take part in the case prompted 
speculation that he may have been concerned about old ties to 
president reagan and his aides including deaver who have been 
targets of independent counsel investigations 
kennedy did some work for reagan when he was governor of 
california at the time kennedy was a lawyer in sacramento 
calif later to be named a federal appeals court judge there 
two other investigations that could be affected by the high 
courts ruling on the special prosecutor law are a probe of the 
irancontra affair and another that resulted in the feb 11 
conviction for illegal lobbying of former white house aide lyn 
nofziger 
but the special prosecutors in both those investigations 
received parallel authority from attorney general edwin meese iii 
that could insulate their investigations from the constitutional 
attack on the independent counsel law there is uncertainty in both 
cases because the investigations began before the backup authority 
was conferred

a former stockbroker was sentenced friday to 120 
weekends in jail and fined 10000 for his role in the insider 
trading scandal that involved a wall street journal reporter 
peter brant also was placed on probation for five years and 
ordered to do 750 hours of community service us district judge 
charles e stewart did not say what the community service would be 
brant 35 a former broker at kidder peabody amp co pleaded 
guilty in 1984 to conspiracy and securities fraud he admitted his 
part in a scheme to trade stock in 24 companies on the basis of 
information that was to appear in the journals heard on the 
street column 
the material brant received came from r foster winans a 
journal reporter who wrote the column during a fivemonth period 
the scheme netted almost 700000 of which winans got 31000 and 
brant got most of the rest 
winans whose mail wire and securities fraud convictions were 
upheld by the us supreme court last november is serving an 
18month sentence brants sentencing was delayed pending the high 
court decision and because of his cooperation in other cases 
brants lawyer stephen weiner pleaded for leniency asking 
stewart to consider the brutal price already paid by his 
client brant who now works for a telecommunications company in 
west palm beach fla has agreed to stay out of the securities 
business for life 
the judge said he found the defendant at least as guilty as 
mr winans and perhaps more so 
stewart could have sentenced brant to 15 years in prison and 
fined him 30000 but he took into account assistant us attorney 
carl loewensons request that he consider brants cooperation in 
prosecuting two major criminal cases 
one case loewenson referred to was the prosecutions of winans 
winans roommate david carpenter and former kidder peabody broker 
kenneth p felis who had roles in the wall street journal trading 
scheme 
felis is serving six months of weekends and carpenter was placed 
on probation and directed to do community service 
the second case involved former lawyer david wc clark 
convicted last november of embezzling more than 37 million from 
clients from 1980 to 1984 
clark who died of chronic alcoholism a few days before he was 
to be sentenced used the embezzled funds to trade securities based 
on the insider information brant passed on to him from the journal 
column

his brakes had failed but investigators said the bus showed no 
mechanical defects

michael dukakis jabbed gingerly at richard 
gephardt on trade and taxes friday saying the 1981 tax cut his 
democratic presidential rival voted for was one of the biggest 
mistakes in recent american history 
dukakis refrained from directly attacking gephardt as he pressed 
his campaign for southern support in the multistate primaries and 
caucuses on march 8 
no culprits the massachusetts governor said with a smile 
after delivering his speech to an overflow crowd at the lyndon 
johnson school of public affairs without uttering gephardts name 
just good strong positive efforts to get this country moving 
again 
dukakis devoted much of his speech to his campaign message of 
good jobs and real opportunity for all with special emphasis 
on the need for education and research its going to take hard 
workers not high rollers to get america moving again he said 
he spoke as he moved through a threeday southern swing in 
advance of the march 8 primaries most of which will be in southern 
or border states aides said he has begun airing television 
commercials in targeted areas of florida and texas as well as in 
the baltimore area 
if gephardts name was not mentioned dukakis meaning was clear 
when he said in his speech that building walls around america 
was a mistake we tried that 60 years ago and it gave us the 
worst depression in our history he said 
gephardt favors trade legislation that would give the president 
authority to retaliate against trading partners that failed to open 
up their markets 
the missouri congressman also voted for the 1981 reaganomics tax 
cut which passed with substantial help from southern democrats in 
the house 
in seven years that one mistake transformed our nation from 
the worlds largest creditor into the worlds largest debtor 
dukakis said 
reaganomics isnt an economic theory its theft from our 
children he said its a felony against the future and it has 
played the hardworking taxpaying families of middle america for 
fools 
the governors speech reflected at least a temporary decision to 
remain above the fray in an increasingly fierce rhetorical battle 
gephardt sharply attacked dukakis earlier this week and the 
governor said on thursday his rival better watch out if he 
persisted 
in his speech dukakis said he has no southern strategy for 
the primaries on march 8 the people of texas and florida and 
virginia arent voting for a zip code theyre voting for a 
president of the united states he said

us companies surveyed by the government 
reported a loss of 238 billion in 1986 because of foreign piracy 
of us patents trademarks and copyrights according to a us 
international trade commission study released friday 
the itc said actual losses are much greater because not all 
companies filled out questionaires on the subject 
the commission said it received responses from 431 companies 
the questionaire was sent to 736 us companies including all 
those on the fortune 500 list 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said that the annual 
drain on us companies because of inadequate protection of 
intellectual property actually may run as high as 43 billion to 
61 billion 
the failure of our trading partners to provide effective 
protection for intellectual property is a severe and growing 
problem that distorts trade yeutter told a news conference 
called to release the study 
the report came in advance of discussions next week in geneva on 
developing a new international code to protect patents trademarks 
and copyrights the talks are being held under the auspices of the 
95nation general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which is 
at work on a new set of global trade rules 
the united states is seeking much tighter protection for 
intellectual property rights and unified standards 
industries hardest hit by intellecutalproperty piracy include 
sceintific medical and photographic equipment computers and 
software electronics entertainment motor vehicles and 
pharmaceuticals yeutter said 
nations cited most frequently as having inadequate protection of 
intellecutal property included mexico brazil taiwan korean and 
japan 
however yeutter declined to single out any particular country 
as the worst offender telling reporters its not just developing 
countries there is ample opportunity to improve among most of the 
nations of the world 
piracy of us movies and musical recordings is a major problem 
area the study said 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america told the news conference piracy is a toxic waste it 
is life threatening it is a global war and we are fighting it on 
every front 
the commission which undertook the study at yeutters request 
said its figures represent only a partial approximation of us 
losses from piracy 
the data collected by the commissions questionaire cannot be 
projected to us industry as a whole with any statistical 
validity the report said the universe of all us businesses 
is unknown and those companies responding do not represent a 
random sample

their homes and scores of people died in battles between 
conservative vigilantes and the squattercamp groups 
this year the fighting is between two groups who fought together 
against the vigilantes in 1986 and appears to involve an 
attempt by the militant youths to gain more power in the 
administration of the squatter camp

prime minister yitzhak shamir urged secretary 
of state george shultz to move slowly on palestinian selfrule and 
15 prominent arabs didnt show up for a meeting friday night to 
which shultz had invited them 
shultz went to a hotel in arab east jerusalem stood in the 
floodlit courtyard and read a statement suggesting the palestinians 
were fearful of working with the united states 
peacemaking is difficult he read peace has its enemies 
but peace is a necessary ingredient to a decent life even small 
steps toward peace can be significant in moving beyond distrust and 
hatred 
shultz is here pursuing new american proposals for middle east 
peace 
the noshow was not new for him a group of palestinians also 
refused to meet him in jerusalem during a visit last october 
in the statement he read friday night against a backdrop of 
moslem evening prayers in the distance shultz still pursued the 
goal of bringing palestinians into middle east peace talks 
opportunity knocks loudly on your door he read out in the 
hotel courtyard now is the time to get to work we have a 
workable plan and we are ready to commit our efforts to it the 
time is right together to make decisions of historic 
proportions 
earlier friday several palestinians issued statements saying 
they would not attend the meeting the palestine liberation 
organization had told palestinians from the west bank and gaza 
strip where riots began more than 11 weeks ago not to meet with 
shultz in jerusalem 
mr shultz seems to be trying to make a political statement by 
insisting on a meeting here that the palestinian problem is in the 
context of civil religious and perhaps economic rights said 
sari nusseibeh a professor at bir zeit university in the west bank 
by saying i will not attend im saying this is wrong the 
problem is one of the national rights of the palestinians 
hanna siniora editor of the newspaper al fajr said he told 
shultz i regret i cannot accept because the palestinian people 
have decided that we have to have a delegation reflecting the true 
composition of the palestinian people siniora conferred with the 
secretary earlier this month in washington 
shultz met on friday with the three principal members of 
israels coalition government shamir foreign minister shimon 
peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin 
he put no pressure whatsoever on shamir an israeli official 
said on condition of anonymity the official said shamir urged 
shultz to move slowly on selfrule in the west bank and gaza strip 
during a twohour meeting shamir told shultz there should be 
a time of testing of up to three years before negotiations on a 
final settlement in the occupied territories the official said 
the american plan calls for negotiaitons on an overall settlement 
by december 
the attempt by shamir to keep alive the 1978 camp david formula 
for interim palestinian selfrule puts shultz in the middle 
between israel and the arabs egypt and jordan have declared the 
process out of date 
shamir also insisted that palestinian autonomy which would 
involve some selfrule but not statehood not be accelerated 
because of the current violence the israeli official said 
peres shamirs partner and rival in the national unity 
coalition said he found shultz openminded and very attentive 
looking for fresh ideas and information 
he brought workable proposals the foreign minister 
saidwe have some workable proposals and for that reason we have 
started to work 
rabin the defense minister said arab demonstrators should have 
no illusion that by force they can change the position of 
israel 
a solution is possible only through negotiations involving 
palestinians who live in the west bank and gaza along with jordan 
and israel he said 
he told reporters they are going to suffer more than anybody 
else by the violence by military means we can achieve 
tranquility but not a solution 
peres and rabin represent the centerleft labor party which for 
20 years has proposed that israel yield some of the occupied 
territory as part of an overall peace settlement shamir and his 
conservative likud bloc oppose trading land for peace which shultz 
has suggested 
shultz flies to amman on saturday to meet with prime minister 
zaid rifai of jordan then to damascus to see the syrian president 
hafez assad 
he also will travel to cairo during his fiveday shuttle for 
which jerusalem is the base

a young white man sentenced earlier this week to 
work for the naacp by a judge who hoped to end a cycle of hate 
faced new charges of ethnic intimidation friday for allegedly 
punching and shouting slurs at a pregnant woman 
its very disappointing cook county circuit judge stuart 
nudelman said of the new charges against james kalafut jr 21 
ive done these type of communityservice sentences before and 
theyve been successful 
unfortunately perhaps this one may not be that remains to be 
seen 
kalafut was back in nudelmans court friday to face charges of 
ethnic intimidation battery and violation of his courtsupervised 
sentence accused of punching a pregnant woman in the stomach and 
shouting ethnic slurs at her 
the woman has an hispanic surname 
kalafut had pleaded guilty tuesday to ethnic intimidation and 
aggravated assault for an aug 16 1987 incident in which a group 
of whites brandishing baseball bats hurling bottles and shouting 
racial slurs chased two blacks from their neighborhood 
nudelman said kalafut had been taught to hate blacks and 
sentenced him to perform 200 hours of community service for the 
national association for the advancement of colored people he also 
sentenced the young man to one year of court supervision 
the judge said he imposed the sentence in an effort to stop 
the cycle of hate however the sentencing plan was put on hold 
and will be set aside if kalafut is convicted on the new charges 
the judge said 
nudelman said friday that if the younger kalafut is found guilty 
of the new charges the young man unfortunately will be in a 
position where he may need an alternative form of punishment such 
as some time in the county jail 
defense attorney barry silver said kalafut had met with naacp 
officials and worked out a plan to collect and distribute clothing 
to poor families and victims of house fires 
the judge transferred the two new charges to judge leo holt 
saying it wouldnt be fair for me to hear them a trial before 
holt was tentatively scheduled for march 28 
silver said the new charges were trumped up and said he believes 
kalafut was framed because of his guilty plea and sentence in the 
earlier incident 
i interviewed two witnesses who tell me he never touched the 
girl who lived nearby silver said im told there has been 
bad feelings between the families for quite some time 
the charges stem from an argument late wednesday in front of the 
kalafut home between virginia flores 27 who is 4 months 
pregnant and kenneth kolokowski 25 
the couple said kalafut came out of his house yelled at them 
and then got into a struggle with kolokowski said police officer 
al murphy 
kalafut then allegedly punched ms flores in the stomach and 
shouted an ethnic slur murphy quoted the couple as saying 
the defendant apparently considers ms flores to be of hispanic 
origin although ms flores told police she is primarily of irish 
heritage with some indian background murphy said 
she suffered minor injuries but her fetus was not harmed said a 
spokesman for holy cross hospital where she was treated and 
released 
the couple also told police the defendants father james 
kalafut sr 45 came out of the house during the confrontation 
wearing pajama bottoms and exposed himself murphy said 
silver said friday the allegation was false 
the elder kalafut charged with ethnic intimidation and battery 
faces an april 14 court hearing 
kalafuts teenage brother larry was sentenced last march to 
six years in prison for firebombing the home of a black family who 
moved into gage park a predominantly white neighborhood

not correspond with the facts in panama and he denounced

the panama canal beyond the year 1999 when a treaty stipulates 
that panama will take over control of the waterway

a rookie policeman was killed in his patrol car 
friday by three pointblank shots to the head in what the police 
commissioner said was an assassination meant to intimidate a crime 
witness 
officer edward byrne 22 was shot as he sat in a marked patrol 
car in queens guarding the home of a threatened witness in a drug 
case the house had been firebombed twice allegedly by dealers 
two men drove up to the patrol car at 330 am one man got out 
and fired up to five shots into the patrol car said police 
commissioner benjamin ward 
the gunman had approached the car in a way not likely to alarm 
the police officer that anything was amiss and then when he was so 
close that he could not miss and moving so rapidly that the police 
officer would not be able to respond defensively fired into the 
car the commissioner said 
byrne was the first officer killed in the line of duty this 
year said police spokesman sgt peter sweeney three city police 
officers and one transit police officer were killed in 1987 
ward acknowledged that the shooting could have been an act of 
random violence but said it smacks more of a deliberate 
assassination attempt 
he described the shooting as an attempt to intimidate not just 
that witness but all of you and all of the people of this city and 
this country to say that if you cooperate with criminal justice 
something is going to happen to you 
the resident of the house is a witness in impending cases 
against area drug dealers 
the house was firebombed twice in november by drug dealers who 
believed the man had complained to police about drug dealing on his 
street police said 
southeast queens has become a hub of crack trafficking and 
drugrelated violence in the last two years many shootings in the 
area are the result of constant turf wars between drug cartels 
ward said 
authorities assigned a 24hour police guard to the house after 
the firebombings ward said the witness has also received other 
threats against his life for cooperating with authorities 
he said assigning a single officer was standard practice the 
patrol car was provided for the officers convenience because of 
the weather 
ward said having two officers in the patrol car would not make a 
difference in officers safety if an assassin decides to arrive 
byrne was single and was a second generation police officer his 
father matthew byrne headed the departments legal bureau from 
1972 to 1976

a state judge friday formally dismissed 
22yearold triple murder charges against rubin hurricane 
carter a week after prosecutors said they would not seek a third 
trial of the former boxer 
im joyous with the result and deeply satisfied that justice 
finally has been done and the charges dismissed said carters 
attorney myron beldock after superior court judge ralph v martin 
signed the order dismissing the indictment against carter and john 
artis 
carter had served 19 years in prison before a federal judge in 
1985 voided his second conviction and ordered his release on 
grounds that the conviction was tainted by racial bias and the 
witholding of information from the defense 
carter who has been living in seclusion could not be reached 
for comment beldock would not release his telephone number or 
whereabouts but said his client would meet with reporters monday 
prosecutors had said dismissal of the charges was justified 
because of the passage of time since the 1966 killings problems 
finding witnesses court decisions descrediting previous testimony 
and the burden posed by a third prosecution 
they also cited the time served in prison by the defendants 
artis who was paroled in 1981 is serving a sixyear term on an 
unrelated drug conviction 
carter and artis were convicted in 1967 but given a new trial 
in 1976 after two witnesses recanted they were convicted again 
and the verdicts were upheld by the state supreme court 
the federal judges decision releasing carter from prison was 
upheld by an appellate court and the us supreme court refused to 
accept an appeal by prosecutors 
carter 50 and artis 41 had been accused of killing a 
bartender and two patrons of a paterson bar the victims were 
white and the gunmen like carter and artis were black 
hours earlier a black paterson bartender had been shot to death 
by a white man prosecutors theorized that the later killings were 
in retaliation 
celebrities such as muhammed ali and actress ellen burstyn took 
up carters cause viewing him as a symbol of racial injustice bob 
dylan wrote and sang hurricane a ballad about the boxers case

americans incomes rose 03 percent in 
january a moderate increase that matched the gain in consumer 
spending during the month the government reported friday 
the commerce department said that incomes and spending both rose 
03 percent following identical 07 percent advances in both 
categories during december 
the gains were taken as positive signs that consumer spending 
while not growing as briskly as it did during the early years of 
the economic recovery will at least expand enough this year to 
keep the economy out of a recession 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity is being closely monitored following the october 
stock market collapse 
these figures support our impression that the economy will 
slow down this year but continue to move ahead said roger 
brinner an economist with data resources inc of lexington mass 
consumer spending after adjusting for inflation fell at an 
annual rate of 31 percent in the fourth quarter the biggest 
decline in more than seven years brinner predicted that much of 
this decline would be reversed in the current januarymarch 
quarter in part because auto sales have rebounded 
wages and salaries the key component of the income category 
increased 124 billion in january more than double the 56 
billion december increase this gain included a 2 billion increase 
in payrolls at manufacturing companies which followed a 11 
billion december increase 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said the rise 
in incomes while below previous months was still strong enough to 
support further increases in spending he noted that incomes in 
manufucturing have risen 47 percent in the past 12 months 
compared to growth of just 18 percent in the previous 12 months 
we have a picture of a consumer with adequate income growth 
who has become a bit more cautious and is more likely to save but 
is not going to stop spending and drive the economy into a 
recession sinai said 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income rose to 47 percent in january 03 percentage point higher 
than the december level 
the 03 percent increase in spending reflected an annual rate of 
increase of 10 billion with almost all of the strength coming in 
the services category 
purchases of durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years edged up 200 million compared to a 123 billion december 
advance purchases of nondurable goods fell 700 million in 
contrast to an increase of 53 billion in december 
the services category which includes housing expenses shot up 
at an annual rate of 106 billion in january much faster than the 
42 billion december rise some analysts said this reflected in 
large part a big jump in inflation in the services sector during 
the month 
in a separate report friday the labor department said that 
medical care services rose 08 percent the steepest increase in 
two years while rental costs and other service charges also posted 
big gains 
in january and december personal income was affected by a 
variety of special factors including pay raises for federal 
employees costofliving adjustments for social security 
recipients and swings in farm subsidy payments 
farm incomes fell 105 billion in january erasing a 104 
billion december increase excluding the big swings in government 
subsidies farm incomes would have increased 500 million in 
janaury following a 15 billion december decline 
aftertax incomes rose 06 percent in january following a 07 
percent december increase

panamas ambassador to washington said he 
refused an order friday by military strong man miguel antonio 
noriega to resign and would continue to serve as envoy under 
usrecognized president eric arturo delvalle 
ambassador juan sosa also said a us trade embargo might be 
necessary to depose noriega and acknowledged that delvalle has no 
support in the military 
sosa declared his support for delvalle hours before the state 
department said it would continue to recognize him even though he 
was ousted by panamas national assembly after he tried to fire 
noriega as military chief 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the us government 
still considered sosa panamas legal ambassador 
sosa said at a news conference that he expects noriega to 
appoint a rival ambassador but he said later that he would retain 
his office with the full backing of his embassy staff in washington 
sosa said he had not contacted other panamanian envoys around 
the world and did not know whether others would support delvalle 
he said however he expects official recognition of delvalles 
government from several other countries 
the envoy said he told noriega in a telephone call friday that 
as a member of delvalles republican party he still considered him 
president of the country noriega asked for his resignation and he 
refused sosa said 
he noted that as ambassador for four months he had opposed 
economic sanctions against panama but there are some times in 
the history of nations when economic sanctions are needed to get 
the country back on track 
we certainly hope that not only the u s but the whole 
hemisphere will support panama and if necessary apply economic 
sanctions to help panama get back onto the road of democracy 
sosa said 
he said however delvalle would not support us military 
intervention 
sosa said he did not expect reprisals against the 50000 us 
citizens in panama and predicted the crisis could be resolved by 
peaceful means 
he denied that us pressure had led to delvalles attempt to 
depose noriega saying it is a step that has been taken 
consciously and courageously without anyone elses help 
asked if there were any signs of support for delvalle in the 
military sosa said the national defense forces are very united 
there might be dissent but i dont know of it 
we do not have any military support we only have the weapon 
of being right he said

the shuttles return flight is not going to be a safe one 
roger boisjoly told student engineers thursday during a speech on 
professional ethics in oklahoma city

boisjoly contends in another suit that morton thiokol and the 
national aeronautics and space administration conspired to ensure 
that the company would be the sole supplier of solidrocket motors

ayrikyan an armenian activist 
for the past week unsanctioned mass demonstrations have rocked 
yerevan protesters are demanding that nagornokarabakh an 
autonomous region of the neighboring republic of azerbaidzhan be 
made part of armenia 
protests also were reported earlier in the week in 
nagornokarabakh where more than 80 percent of the 157000 
residents are armenians 
the armenian national committee an anticommunist group based 
in athens greece claimed that azerbaidjanis killed more than 70 
armenians in the disputed region

azerbaidzhan to show civic maturity and restraint the official 
tass news agency reported 
he said the central committee will meet to examine relations 
among the countrys more than 100 ethnic groups tass said 
in a late night dispatch tass reported that gorbachev 
acknowledged there are unresolved problems in the life of soviet 
society but the fomenting of strife and mistrust among peoples 
only hinders their resolution 
one witness said the demonstrators did not begin dispersing 
immediately after hearing the address read by politburo member 
vladimir i dolgikh 
they began leaving a few hours later after learning that the 
armenian central committee had requested the national central 
committee to reconsider the annexation proposal said the witness

feelings it had a calm tone and was warm without the usual 
rhetoric 
earlier friday sergei grigoryants a dissident of armenian 
origin estimated that more than 1 million people were in yerevans 
streets friday morning 
columns are marching along the major streets and there is a 
sea of banners he said

authority gostelradio put the number of demonstrators at more than 
a million 
aidinyan said his crowd size estimate was in the range of tens 
of thousands or hundreds of thousands 
there has been no official estimate of the number of 
demonstrators and the government has barred foreign reporters from 
traveling to armenia

earlier to have been closed by a strike in support of the 
protesters had returned to normal

central committee member identified only as s petrosyan 
armenia is the smallest of the 15 soviet republics in area and 
has 34 million inhabitants by annexing nagornokarabakh which at 
1760 square miles is smaller than delaware armenias area would 
increase by 14 percent and its population by 4 percent 
the protests test gorbachevs campaign for greater 
democratization and openness and his personal appeal showed how 
seriously the kremlin leadership regards the situation gorbachev 
has said relations among the soviet unions nationalities are the 
countrys greatest problem 
grigoryants said protesters carried signs linking their actions 
with gorbachevs policies of glasnost or openness and 
perestroika his broad plan for rebuilding soviet society 
the speech marked the first time gorbachev has personally 
intervened in a nationalities dispute 
even in december 1986 when rioting broke out in the central 
asian republic of kazakhstan killing three and injuring hundreds 
gorbachev did not surface

health and human service secretary otis r 
bowen on friday announced the formation of a federal task force to 
focus on aids among children 
the purpose of the initiative is to cut across agency lines 
ensuring that we provide not only the best medical response but 
also the best use of our social programs on behalf of these 
children and their families bowen said at the latest in a series 
of department briefings on aids 
dr antonia c novello of the national institute of child health 
and human development heads the newly designated pediatric hiv 
infection working group which includes representatives from five 
agencies within the sprawling hhs department 
bowen cited emerging evidence that the deadly disease affects 
children somewhat differently than adults as justification for 
designating the special task force 
he said the working group will help carry out the agenda set 
last year at the surgeon generals workshop on children with hiv 
infection and their families 
bowen noted that many agencies within hhs have already been 
working on special problems associated with aids among children he 
cited as an example a plan by the health resources and services 
administration to spend 44 million this year on demonstration 
programs for innovative ways of caring for children with aids 
he also said the office for human development services will be 
funding projects to improve recruitment of foster parents and to 
provide supportive services for natural and foster families of 
children with aids 
there are just over 1000 officially reported aids cases among 
people under 18 years old but bowen said that is projected to 
increase to 3000 in three years 
moreover he added we believe that for every one child who 
meets the definition for aids itself at least another two are hiv 
infected and the number of probably higher by 1991 we expect that 
there will be some 10000 to 20000 hivinfected children in the 
united states 
existing evidence suggests that most children infected with the 
virus eventually develop the disease itself

panamas president eric arturo delvalle knew 
in advance that his attempted firing of gen manuel antonio noriega 
would fail but is confident that planned steps would lead to 
noriegas downfall within three weeks a panamaniam dissident said 
friday 
jose i blandon a onetime noreiga associate said in an 
interview that delvalle has devised an 18point plan for the ouster 
of the military strong man and his unsuccessful bid to replace him 
was but one element 
it is exactly what we thought was going to happen blandon 
said referring to delvalles bid to install the secondranking 
officer in panamas defense forces as commander on thursday and 
noriegas decision to ignore the order 
hours later the panamanian national assembly dominated by 
noriega allies voted to oust delvalle and replace him with the 
education minister but delvalle said he still regards himself as 
president 
blandon said other elements in the effort to topple noriega 
include a general strike the rallying of international support for 
delvalle and the consent of the dominican republic to give noriega 
a safe haven if and when he flees panama 
delvalle received a boost friday when the state department 
announced that it continues to recognize him as president blandon 
said he expects similar support from many latin american 
democracies 
the reagan administration has been increasingly hostile to 
noriega especially since his indictment on drugsmuggling charges 
by federal grand juries in florida three weeks ago 
other aspects of the antinoriega plot blandon said include a 
purging of panamas defense forces leading to the ouster of six 
majors he said are involved in drug trafficking and eight colonels 
who are serving in violation of rules requiring retirement after 25 
years service 
if noriega leaves col elias castillo the thirdranking member 
of the defense forces would take command blandon said castillo is 
a military professional is untainted by corruption and leads a 
modest middleclass existence that contrasts sharply with the 
opulent life styles of some of noriegas close military associates 
castillo is not involved in drugs and hes clean blandon 
said hes a good soldier he does not have political ambitions 
with us marshals deployed nearby blandon sat in a local hotel 
suite and outlined how he delvalle and a group of other opposition 
leaders have been planning to restore civilian rule in panama 
noriega once looked on blandon as a close confidante but the 
two had a falling out last fall after blandon told the military 
chieftain that panamas crisis can only be solved if he steps down 
blandon is under us government protection because of testimony 
he gave outlining noriegas alleged drugsmuggling activities and 
his ties with the cia among other issues 
during his 90minute conversation with a reporter blandon 
perused a document he said was an 18point plan for restoring 
civilian supremacy in panama it was dated feb 22 but blandon 
said the essentials of the plan had been worked out by himself 
delvalle and opposition leaders weeks earlier 
blandon said that during a meeting in miami last week delvalle 
asked assistant secretary of state elliott abrams if it would be 
possible to drop the indictments against noriega 
abrams replied that it would be legally possible but that any 
such decision would have to be made by either the justice 
department or president reagan blandon said 
withdrawal of the indictments presumably would leave noriega 
free to seek a safe haven outside panama without fear of us 
extradition but blandon said the administration has given no 
indication it would agree to lift the indictments 
he said authorities in the dominican republic where noriega has 
a soninlaw have agreed to allow him and five to seven associates 
into the country should he be forced out noriega has been informed 
of this development he said 
but if the indictments remain in place noriega would be subject 
to us extradition under a treaty with the dominican republic 
still blandon said he was confident that noriegas days as 
defense chief are numbered particularly if there is widespread 
adherence to a scheduled call for a general strike and if the 
united states imposes an economic embargo against panama 
he said alaskan oil is shipped through a panamanian pipeline for 
eventual delivery to us east coast ports an embargo would 
prevent continued use of the pipeline by american companies 
depriving panama of millions of dollars of badly needed revenue and 
aggravating what he described as the countrys acute financial 
crisis

highest level since the early 1970s the agriculture department

million bales of cotton were used by mills up from 64 million in 
1986 as it looks now 1988 mill use is headed for another gain to 
around 78 million bales 
but imports of cotton textiles also are up totaling an 
equivalent of 49 million bales in 1987 a 22 percent increase from 
1986 the departments economic research service said

7 million bales in the 1988 marketing year an increase of 300000 
bales from 1987 the agency said in its new outlook report 
based on jan 1 indications the 1987 cotton harvest which 
goes into the overall supply for the 1988 marketing year is 
expected to yield 147 million bales up from 97 million bales in 
1986 
cotton prices moved up last year because of the tighter supply 
and rising demand the us spot price for example rose above 77 
cents per pound the report said but since last august prices have 
dropped by 17 to 20 cents 
the largerthanexpected 1987 us crop the potential for 
increased acreage and production in 1988 and concern about the 
economys performance have pressured prices lower this season

the air force said friday it had launched an 
environmental impact study of bases that could be used as garrisons 
for railmounted mx nuclear missiles 
in conducting the study the service said it would review a 
number of deployment alternatives including the fielding of 100 mx 
missiles on rail cars instead of just 50 missiles 
defense secretary frank c carlucci disclosed recently the 
administration would like to move the 50 mx missiles that congress 
already has approved for silo basing to rail cars along with a new 
batch of 50 missiles 
congress has yet to approve any type of mobile deployment for 
the 10warhead mx but it has provided researchanddevelopment 
funding since president reagan unveiled the idea in december 1986 
the air force announced a year ago it had selected fe warren 
air force base in wyoming to become the main operating base for any 
railmounted mx missiles and 10 other bases for consideration as 
additional rail garrisons 
the service said friday that list had not changed and that 
special meetings to identify environmental issues would be 
scheduled soon for residents living near each of those 11 bases 
besides fe warren the list includes blytheville air force 
base ark little rock air force base ark whiteman air force 
base mo barksdale air force base la dyess air force base 
texas fairchild air force base wash grand forks air force base 
nd minot air force base nd malstrom air force base mont 
and wurtsmith air force base mich 
the air force said it hoped to complete the impact study by late 
this year and make the final selection of home bases 
the air force envisions either 25 or 50 sixcar trains with 
each train carrying two mx missiles each garrison could house 
four five or six trains 
the missiles would be carried in specially modified cargo cars 
made to look like a regular boxcar to launch the missile the top 
of the box car would open outward allowing the missile to be 
erected into a vertical position and fired 
the trains would remain inside the heavily guarded garrisons 
during peacetime but could disperse onto the regular commercial 
rail system in the event of an emergency the pentagons goal would 
be to have a mobile target that the soviet union could not destroy 
the air force says it has made no decision on how many rail 
garrison bases it needs out of the list of 10 besides fe warren 
the air force which calls the mx the peacekeeper missile said 
the proposed action is to deploy a total of 50 peacekeeper 
missiles on 25 air force trains with two missiles per train but an 
alternative action is to deploy 100 peacekeeper missiles on 50 
trains

three companies accused of selling thousands of 
pounds of nonkosher poultry as kosher to customers in up to 22 
states have agreed in a legal settlement to get out of the kosher 
business officials said friday 
we wanted to make sure something like this never happened 
again said rabbi victor segal president of goldmansegal kosher 
caterers of chicago which had accused the three companies of fraud 
in a federal lawsuit it was a nightmare 
segal said it was the largest case of fraud involving 
mislabeling of kosher foods and potentially affected jewish 
families in 22 states where the companies kosher poultry products 
were sold 
jewish religious law restricts the type of meats that can be 
eaten and mandates a ritual for butchering the meats and removing 
as much blood as possible to make them kosher the process is 
lengthy and more expensive segal said 
in middecember segals catering company sued the chicagobased 
companies united poultry inc aspen foods inc and shelat kosher 
foods inc and two of their officers in federal court accusing 
them of false advertising fraud and deceptive trade practices the 
catering company had bought kosher poultry products from united 
poultry segal said 
a month earlier the illinois attorney general had filed a state 
lawsuit against the companies as well as sheldon terman president 
of the three firms and michael terman the companies secretary 
for allegedly mislabeling their products as kosher 
cook county circuit judge anthony scotillo ordered a nationwide 
recall on nov 5 of up to 376000 pounds of poultry processed by 
shelat kosher foods and sold under the shelat label 
the judge also issued a temporary injunction shutting down 
shelat a meatprocessing firm that made specialty kosher poultry 
products such as chicken kiev 
on nov 24 shelat admitted selling nonkosher poultry as kosher 
in a courtissued consent decree and was permanently closed said 
william sullivan chief of the attorney generals consumer 
protection division 
the attorney generals office estimated that shelat made about 
250000 profit from selling cheaper nonkosher poultry at the 
higher kosher prices 
but segal said his catering company was more concerned about the 
possible violations of jewish religious law the mental anguish 
that we had from the possibility of having defiled dishes and ovens 
and flatware was awful he said 
the company also was ordered to pay 250000 in restitution and 
fines and its president sheldon terman was ordered to sell his 
stock in united poultry a company that distributed shelats 
products and other kosher foods 
under fridays settlement united poultry which still was 
distributing other kosher poultry products must stop selling all 
kosher foods by no later than sept 1 and the other two companies 
are also ordered out of the kosher business segal said 
it also specifies a monetary settlement which may not be 
disclosed under terms of the settlement segal said 
we have no complaints about the settlement said harvey 
silets an attorney representing the companies and the termans 
weve agreed to it this is merely a continuation of the matter 
that was initiated by the attorney general 
silets said the company officers accused in the suit would not 
be available for comment 
shelat bought poultry from kosher butchering houses and then 
processed it to make specialty items such as boneless chicken 
breasts stuffed with rice segal said 
but a new employee at shelat noticed that the company was 
sending out more kosherlabeled products than the amount of 
kosherslaughtered chicken it received segal said 
a surprise inspection by the union of orthodox jewish 
congregations found that shelat employees were placing the unions 
kosher labels on poultry that was not kosher segal said

the foreign ministers of six balkan 
nations pledged friday to resolve ethnic disputes in their region 
following a meeting that included the rare participation of albania 
the ministers ended their first postwar meeting by adopting a 
communique in which they also pledged to boost economic 
cooperation participating in the conference were yugoslavia 
albania greece turkey romania and bulgaria 
relations among nearly all the balkan nations are marked by 
ethnic tensions albanian and yugoslav relations have been strained 
over the ethnic albanian minority in the southern yugoslav province 
of kosovo 
the threeday conference was the highestlevel meeting of balkan 
states since world war ii and the first international conference 
outside the united nations to be attended by an albanian foreign 
minister 
it was also the first visit to yugoslavia by an albanian foreign 
minister since belgrade broke with the soviet bloc in 1948 albania 
broke with the bloc in 1960 
albania has been moving toward contact with other nations since 
the death in 1985 of its longtime leader enver hoxha who kept 
albania virtually isolated from the rest of the world 
the adoption of the final document was delayed 9ominutes after 
albania raised objections to some aspects of the text as the host 
country yugoslavia drafted the final document 
albanian foreign minister reis malile and his yugoslav 
counterpart budimir loncar left the conference hall to discuss the 
disputed paragraphs 
loncar asked what albania had objected to said that it 
involved only a sequence of words and paragraphs he refused to 
be more specific 
the communique adopted by the conference encouraged more 
frequent meetings among the balkan leaders the foreign ministers 
agreed to meet periodically but did not set a date for their 
next conference 
addressing the minority issue the communique stated that ethnic 
minorities should be a factor of cohesion stability friendly 
relations and cooperation 
the communique also emphasized the humanitarian aspect of 
cooperation an apparent reference to concerns of some states 
over human rights abuses regarding their ethnic minorities in 
neighboring countries 
bulgaria began a campaign in 1984 to change the names of its 
estimated 1 millionstrong ethnic turkish minority the campaign 
was first reported by turkish newspapers and later confirmed by 
western diplomats in sofia and amnesty international the 
londonbased human rights organization 
albania has also accused yugoslavia of discriminating against 
its ethnic albanian minority and greece has in the past expressed 
concern about the greek minority in albania

the united nations prepared friday for an 
emergency session of the general assembly next week to consider 
us plans to close the un observer mission of the palestine 
liberation organization 
the session by the 159nation group begins monday and is 
expected to last at least three days 
the dispute began after the us congress voted and president 
reagan approved an order last december to shut the plo mission in 
new york effective march 22 
following the congressional action the general assembly voted 
overwhelmingly to urge the united states to abide by its treaty 
obligations and leave the mission alone 
the united nations resolution said the us law violated the 
1947 headquarters agreement which obliges the united states to 
allow un missions to operate 
both the plo and arab league previously said they might seek to 
move the general assembly from new york to geneva if the plo office 
is closed they also have said they could seek a ruling by the

an internal revenue service agent and a 
former agent have been charged in a sting operation in which 300 
million of purported drug money was to be laundered and brought 
into the united states federal prosecutors said friday 
william parramore 52 of union city an irs employee for 20 
years and harold brown 33 of albany ga who resigned from an 
irs office in san mateo last year were among four men charged 
after an internal investigation that began in seattle said us 
attorney joseph russoniello 
the investigation last month when ray wilford 26 of des 
moines wash told a government informant posing as a cocaine 
dealer that he had an uncle who worked for the irs and could help 
launder money said irs internal security investigator michael 
charland in a statement filed in federal court 
wilford later identified the uncle as parramore a revenue 
officer group manager in the hayward irs office charland said 
the informant told parramore at an electronically recorded 
meeting jan 14 that he had 300 million in panama and hong kong 
banks and wanted to bring it into the united states without 
trouble charland said 
he said parramore agreed to help in exchange for 10 percent of 
the money and proposed setting up a corporation to launder the 
funds which were to be moved in amounts of 500000 wilford and 
his cousin terrance wilford 25 of seattle were to receive 
50000 charland said 
parramore and ray wilford referred the informant to brown who 
in a recorded feb 5 meeting proposed a plan to move money into the 
united states by setting up three businesses in the san francisco 
bay area that would be financed through loans from foreign banks 
charland said 
he said the informant and an undercover irs agent rejected the 
proposal and that brown promised to work on a new plan 
all four men are charged with conspiracy to commit tax fraud 
punishable by up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine 
parramore was arrested at his home friday and the wilfords were 
arrested in seattle russoniello said brown is being sought

the romanian government apparently weary of 
white house and congressional demands for a better human rights 
performance has renounced american trade benefits given to 
communist countries with good emigration policies us officials 
said friday 
as a result romania could lose up to 250 million in commerce 
with the united states according to romanian figures 
state department spokesman phyllis oakley said romania informed 
the united states through diplomatic channels that it had decided 
to renounce the trade concessions therefore subjecting 
romanian goods to higher tariffs as of july 2 
romania also will lose eligibility for us governmentsupported 
export credits through the commodity credit corp or the 
exportimport bank mrs oakley said 
the announcement reflected a growing deterioration of relations 
between the united states and romanian leader nicolae ceausescu 
who has been wooed by us administrations in the past because of 
his relatively independent line from moscow 
deputy secretary of state john c whitehead who met ceausescu 
in bucharest three weeks ago informed the romanian leader of us 
dissatisfaction with human rights policies whitehead later told 
reporters that ceausescus replied in essence stop meddling in 
romanias internal affairs 
starting in 1975 presidents ford carter and reagan scrutinized 
romanias emigration policies and repeatedly asked congress to 
waive a rule preventing stateeconomy countries from receiving 
mostfavorednation status the right to lower tariffs 
congress has gone along 
under the jacksonvanik amendment designed to spur the soviet 
union and its allies to permit high levels of emigration by jews 
and other ethnic groups countries that satisfy that human right 
are eligible for the trade benefit on an annually renewable basis 
among soviet bloc countries only romania poland and hungary 
have been recipients 
despite fridays announcement mrs oakley said romania stated 
to us that it will continue to allow emigration for family 
reunification purposes without relation to economic ties with the 
united states we welcome this 
she said romania had also expressed a desire to continue to work 
for better relations 
according to her figures us exports to romania are worth 200 
million annually of which half are agriculture products the 
competitiveness of these exports will suffer she acknowledged 
we think trade will likely shrink 
romania exported goods worth 775 million to the united states 
last year the spokeswoman said she said romania estimates that 
its loss of mostfavored nation status will cost up to 250 million 
in lost exports 
in recent years us diplomats have conferred with the 
ceausescu government on steps romania would be expected to take to 
win president reagans approval of a waiver of the jacksonvanik 
rules 
romania traditionally had satisfied those expectations enough to 
win a presidential waiver and approval by congress but in recent 
years members of congress increasingly have questioned whether 
romanian compliance met the requirements 
many members notably sen paul trible rva asserted that 
romanias continued discrimination against religious minorities and 
its overall supression of free speech political opposition and 
other freedoms warranted cancellation of the trade benefits 
they also rejected arguments by reagan and other presidents that 
the benefits encouraged romania to continue such nonmoscow 
policies as recognition of israel and nonparticipation in warsaw 
pact military maneuvers 
whitehead said after returning from bucharest that the 
administration had not decided whether to ask congress to give 
romania the trade benefits this year even if it made such a 
request there were no assurances congress would grant it he said 
stripping romania of its most favored nation status has been 
under consideration by housesenate negotiators working on new 
trade legislation 
rep christopher smith rnj a sponsor of the tradebenefit 
cutoff said of ceausescus action i think he has done this to 
preempt the annual scrutiny of romanias human rights record 
which is deplorable 
smith said that during a recent visit to bucharest he detected 
a hardened attitude 
hes cutting off his nose to spite his face smith said of 
ceausescu we dont want to end the relationship we just want 
them to stop the trashing of human rights

congressional foes of panamanian strongman 
manuel antonio noriega urged the reagan administration on friday to 
impose an immediate and total trade embargo to force him from power 
some said the administration should not rule out at least as 
an option the use of military force to oust noriega the general 
who heads panamas defense forces 
noriega was indicted in the united states recently on charges of 
taking millions of dolllars to turn panama into a haven for drugs 
and the profits they generate 
others said the united states should press the issue at the 
organization for american states and seek the widest possible 
consensus in the western hemisphere for noriegas removal and for 
the restoration of democracy in panama 
but senate majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia said 
the united states needs to keep coolas it reviews its options 
in dealing with noreiga especially in light of the continuing us 
need to protect free passage through the panama canal 
there was almost universal rejection on capitol hill of 
noriegas claim that the united states is attempting to use 
corruption charges against him to renege on the us committment to 
turn the canal over to panama by the year 2000 
that statement by gen noriega is piffle pap and political 
flim flam intended to preserve his own interests byrd told 
reporters 
that is an absolute and total and complete fabrication said 
sen david boren dokla its the old trick of when you get 
caught with your hand in the till of trying to raise some red 
herring to draw attention from yourself 
sen alfonse damato rny said he spoke to panamanian 
president eric arturo delvalle by telephone at midday on friday 
he said to me he would be fully supportive of a trade 
embargo damato told reporters that would be the kind of 
decisive action the united states should follow through on 
damato said that while he does not believe the united states 
should now intervene militarily we should not preclude military 
action if that is necessary to protect the vital interests of the 
united states 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said the united states should 
press the organization of american states oas to accept the 
credentials of a new ambassador sent by devalle and cancel the 
credentials of noriegas ambassador 
he said that would make clear where the democracies of the 
hemisphere stand on the matter 
the action that the oas takes will speak volumes about whether 
that is a meaningful organization or whether it should not be taken 
seriously kennedy said 
sen john kerry dmass who heads a senate foreign relations 
committee investigation into noriegas alleged links to narcotics 
racketeering and money laundering said the united states should 
consider suspending landing rights for panamanaian aircraft and 
stop the export of us technology to that country 
but he said that because panama uses us currency as legal 
tender the most telling step would be to suspend the transfer of 
us dollars to and from panama 
sen alan simpson rwyo the senates deputy gop leader 
called for a bipartisan movement to deal with a squirrel like 
noriega whos got his mailed fist on the levers of the locks of the 
canal 
i think you will find noriega will leave once the united 
states makes a flatfooted stand said sen jesse helms rnc 
a leading critic both of noriega and of the treaties which call for 
the canal to be turned over to panama in the year 2000 
just embargo panama helms said

federal prosecutors said friday they intended 
to appeal a judges ruling that the fbi illegally obtained a 
confession from a lebanese hijacking suspect who is scheduled to go 
to trial next month 
assistant us attorney ramsey johnson said prosecutors had 
asked solicitor general charles fried to approve an appeal of us 
district judge barrington parkers order suppressing the confession 
of fawaz younis 
parker ruled earlier this week that the fbi illegally 
interrogated younis over a fourday period on a navy vessel after 
the suspect was lured onto an fbichartered yacht off cyprus and 
arrested last sept 13 
younis is scheduled to go on trial march 22 on charges he led 
the june 11 1985 hijacking of a royal jordanian airliner carrying 
three americans 
the plane was blown up at beirut international airport the next 
day after the passengers and crew were taken off the aircraft 
parker ruled that the fbi should have provided younis with an 
attorney for the interrogation which occurred on board a navy 
munitions boat that slowly steamed from cyprus to a rendezvous with 
an aircraft carrier from which younis was flown to washington 
the judge found that younis whose wrists were fractured when he 
was grabbed by fbi agents and slammed to the deck of the yacht was 
in no physical condition to freely waive his fifth amendment right 
against selfincrimination before he was interrogated 
the judge was sharply critical of the fbis arrest and 
interrogation saying the only reason the fbi kept younis aboard 
the ship for four days was to extract a confession 
an appeal of parkers order could delay the proceeding if the 
us circuit court of appeals agrees to take the case and does not 
make a ruling before the trial date

the senate refused on friday for the eighth 
time in a year to allow a floor vote on a democratic proposal to 
limit campaign spending but supporters and republican foes agreed 
that the battle wasnt over 
a move by majority leader robert c byrd dwva to halt 
debate failed again on a 5341 roll call after 53 hours of 
roundtheclock filibustering led by republicans the bill was 
promptly shelved probably for the rest of the year 
the democrats thus fell seven votes short of the necessary 
60vote majority required to invoke cloture or to gag debate even 
though democrats got the votes of republicans john chafee of rhode 
island robert stafford of vermont and nancy landon kassebaum of 
kansas 
democratic leaders of the fight to curb the escalating costs of 
senate campaigning which averaged 3 million per candidate in 
1986 said they were disappointed but not downhearted by their 
latest setback 
they claimed enough votes to pass the bill by a simple majority 
if the cloture petition had succeeded but byrd declared that the 
campaign finance issue will not be swept under the rug 
sen david boren dokla said this is not the end of the 
fight for campaign reform this is but the beginning and 
assistant gop leader alan k simpson of wyoming agreed 
weve sliced the snake into seven sections and today well lop 
off the head for the eighth time but it will rise again from the 
sand simpson said 
by all accounts the bill was killed by unwavering republican 
opposition to a provision that would have given senate candidates 
incentives to limit voluntarily their spending in general election 
campaigns starting in 1990 the ceilings would have ranged from 
950000 to 55 million depending on the size of a states 
population 
under the bill specialinterest political action committees 
could have supplied no more than 20 percent of a participating 
candidates funds in 1986 these pacs accounted for more than half 
the campaign money spent by more than 200 house and senate 
candidates most of them incumbents 
republicans complained as sen mitch mcconnell of entucky put 
it that the bill was crafted to aid the democrats at the expense 
of republicans especially by limiting funds available to gop 
candidates challenging democratic incumbents in larger states 
boren and other democrats denied such an aim but gop senators 
remained convinced that the bill would serve to perpetuate 
democratic control of the senate which they seized in 1986 
mcconnell said republicans would never accept campaign spending 
limits we didnt do it today he said we wont do it ever 
but the issue which sen james exon dneb called a ticking 
time bomb out there was clearly far from dead we will revisit 
the issue in one form or another byrd said its not going to 
go away 
the majority leader suggested that one option might be a 
proposed constitutional amendment which reportedly has some 
bipartisan support that would seek to override a supreme court 
ruling against mandatory limits on congressional campaign spending 
but simpson warned that republicans would be waiting i know 
there will be some more proposals like this and when they come up 
theyll be dealt with like this he said 
the latest senate battle over campaign spending followed a 
record seven cloture attempts by the democratic leadership last 
year all of them in vain wound up with a fusillade of floor 
rhetoric 
in a futile appeal for votes to halt the debate byrd asked his 
colleagues whether the senate is going to become the fortress of 
special interests and the citadel of men of wealth 
sen george mitchell dmaine said the republicans have made 
a miscalculation of historic proportions because incumbents tend 
to spend more on senate campaigns than their challengers 
unless gop senators agree to spending limits mitchell said 
it is possible there will be a republican minority in the senate 
for the rest of this century 
republicans began filibustering tuesday afternoon in an effort 
to block a vote on the bill which the democrats were virtually 
certain to win byrd responded by ordering nonstop debate in an 
effort to wear the republicans down and focus attention on their 
stalling tactics 
things turned nasty early wednesday when senators nearly all 
of them democrats approved a byrd motion to have absentee 
republicans arrested and returned to the chamber 
plainclothes capitol police seized sen robert packwood rore 
in his office and carried him feetfirst into the senate chamber 
giving byrd the quorum of 51 senators that he needed to keep the 
filibuster alive

gov mario cuomo on friday criticized 
lawyers for a black teenager who says she was assaulted by six 
white men accusing the lawyers of making up conditions that 
have blocked her testimony 
a lawyer for tawana brawley said cuomos remarks were down in 
the gutter 
meanwhile an aunt of miss brawleys aunt was quoted in a 
newspaper interview as saying the girl hadnt even talked about the 
case with the lawyers who have refused to allow her to cooperate 
with investigators 
miss brawley 16 was reported missing for four days in 
november she was found wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and 
covered with feces with racial epithets scrawled on her body she 
has said one of the men who assaulted her flashed a police badge 
and had a holster 
she and her family of wappingers falls north of new york city 
have refused to be questioned on the advice of attorneys c vernon 
mason and alton maddox jr of new york city who have pressed for a 
special prosecutor acceptable to them 
they said they had reasons they could not cooperate its 
clear now they dont really cuomo said referring to the 
lawyers these conditions obviously dont mean anything they 
keep making up new conditions what has become more and more 
apparent is they simply dont want to cooperate for reasons that i 
dont understand 
cuomo said he was willing to do anything to help move the case 
along including meeting with miss brawley if her lawyers and the 
special state prosecutor he appointed thought that might help her 
lawyers have rejected that idea 
at a news conference in newburgh on friday mason blasted 
cuomos remarks and compared new york to mississippi circa 1954 
i shudder to think how he would deal with gorbachev i shudder 
to think how he would deal with the worlds problems i shudder to 
think of how he would deal with leading the nation mason said 
referring to speculation about cuomo as a potential presidential 
candidate 
he renewed his demand for a new and permanent special state 
prosecutor for racial crimes to replace cuomos selection for the 
brawley case state attorney general robert abrams 
mason said that if cuomo didnt replace abrams he would turn to 
federal authorities for help 
mason and the rev al sharpton said a mass rally against racism 
is planned for saturday in newburgh and neighboring poughkeepsie 
cuomo stood behind abrams and rejected masons claim that the 
attorney general was unable to handle the investigation 
abrams told an albany news conference that he was pressing ahead 
with the investigation miss brawleys cooperation is critically 
important to the investigation he said but he refused to say 
the case couldnt be solved without her help 
the middletown times herald record quoted juanita brawley who 
helped raise tawana for eight years and who has spent time with the 
girl since her attack as saying she is the only one who knows 
enough about the incident to keep the lawyers and the girls mother 
informed 
i know a few things that no one else knows the girls aunt 
said during an interview at her home she said of maddox he has 
not talked to tawana he does not need to talk to tawana she did 
not elaborate 
im not going to address it or dignify it mason said when 
asked about the report 
miss brawley has refused to talk to investigators since shortly 
after she was found the dutchess county district attorney and a 
special local prosecutor both withdrew from the case for 
unspecified conflicts of interest 
miss brawleys supporters without providing specific evidence 
have charged that local law enforcement officials were somehow 
involved in the attack

the cia official who established a secret 
supply network for nicaraguas contra rebels has resigned to go 
into private business becoming at least the fourth agency official 
involved in the irancontra affair to leave his job 
alan fiers a veteran agent who was chief of the agencys 
central american task force has resigned effective march 4 bill 
baker the agencys spokesman said friday 
fiers was one of several cia officials involved in the 
irancontra affair who was reprimanded last year by cia director 
william webster because of his role and his failure to inform 
congress about the activity 
despite that disciplinary action fiers had continued to handle 
central american matters and had briefed members of congress as 
part of the reagan administrations efforts to win renewed military 
aid for the contras 
it was his personal decision to leave said baker who 
called fiers a solid guy and confirmed that he had turned down 
a job as a cia station chief in an unspecified foreign country 
he said he has other options and is going to take them alan had 
a full career here and he knew it 
baker also said the agency is annoyed at elliott abrams the 
assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs who also 
was involved in the administrations clandestine plan to aid the 
contras at a time when congress had prohibited such aid 
abrams quoted in fridays new york times said fiers treatment 
by the cia would send exactly the wrong signal to young officers 
at the agency 
abrams was quoted as saying the handling of fiers case says 
dont get involved in controversial programs because you will end 
up being punished for it he added he has made a great 
contribution to our interests in central america and it is an 
injustice that he is not being rewarded for it 
baker said the agency will complain directly to abrams about 
what he called the impropriety of the remarks 
were very angry at elliott abrams he said its none of 
his business to making comments about case officers and their 
futures 
fiers a former ohio state football player spent nearly 21 
years in the cia after joining in june 1967 at age 48 fiers was 
two years short of reaching the cias early retirement age and 
collecting a substantial pension said one associate who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
webster reprimanded fiers late last year after an internal probe 
of the agencys involvement in the secret sale of us weapons to 
iran and the diversion of profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the reprimand meant fiers could not be promoted for at least two 
years and he apparently saw his career at the agency stalled the 
source said 
after that same investigation webster reportedly fired two 
officials the former station chief in costa rica joe fernandez 
and the chief of a large agency base at aguacate honduras and 
clair george chief of the agencys clandestine service who was 
criticized for his role in the affair retired at the end of last 
year 
during closeddoor testimony before the congressional 
irancontra committees fiers acknowledged that he had withheld 
information from congress about the resupply effort saying so 
long as others who knew the details as much as i were keeping 
their silence on that i was going to keep my silence 
fiers remains under investigation as part of the investigation 
by the governments independent counsel lawrence e walsh into 
the irancontra scandal 
the cia has never disclosed fiers name or position but some 
details of his background and career are known he served as an 
intelligence officer in pakistan and later as station chief in 
saudi arabia which was enlisted by the reagan administration to 
provide 32 million in covert funding for the contras 
fiers played right end and tackle under the legendary ohio state 
football coach woody hayes from 1958 to 1960 he was a biological 
sciences major 
at the cia fiers was credited for skillful work in setting up a 
system to make airdrops of supplies to the rebels fighting the 
leftist sandinista government

although president eric arturo 
delvalle could not dismiss the general who really runs the country 
his attempt will make it harder for other latin american nations to 
support panamas government 
since that has long been a goal of gen manuel antonio noriegas 
opponents leading panamanian dissidents and the us state 
department were quick to cheer delvalles seemingly quixotic move 
its practical result was that noriega stayed in his post as 
military commander and the national legislature dismissed delvalle 
althoguh he refused to relinquish the office and the united states 
supported him 
delvalles order to noriega had the futility of tilting at 
windmills because he had no way to back it up noriega not the 
civilian president controls panamas army police legislature 
and even the game wardens 
it came as no surprise therefore that the commander of the 
national police and the armys chief of staff quickly sided with 
the general against the president 
so too did the national assembly which is dominated by a 
coalition of noriega followers in a 10minute meeting early 
friday it fired delvalle and vice president roderick esquivel 
delvalle said the assemblys action was unconstiutional but his 
only weapon against it is public opinion 
panamas latin american neighbors have been slow to condemn 
noriega despite widespread allegations of involvement in drug 
trafficking and other forms of corruption even murder the general 
has denied all the charges 
noriega has drawn the united states as a straw man accusing it 
of trying to oust him and renege on a 1976 treaty turning the 
panama canal to panama at the turn of the century delvalle took 
that stance himself before the change of heart 
latin american governments are reluctant to side with the united 
states in any dispute involving a neighbor if only to pacify their 
own large numbers of leftleaning voters 
but the spectacle of a legally sitting president firing his top 
general but being fired himself by the generals henchmen is not 
likely to sit well 
this will isolate the government no doubt said mario luis 
del valle vice president of the panama banking association and a 
member of the national civic crusade which began clamoring for 
noriegas ouster last june 
the civic crusade a loose coalition of business professional 
labor and political groups has been trying for months to convince 
other latin american nations that panamas government is not 
legitimate 
aurelio barria president of the chamber of commerce and 
industry and an opposition leader has carried that message 
personally to the presidents of at least half a dozen latin 
american nations 
barria has obtained little support until now but the president 
or expresident predicted that soon would change 
i think it will be another blow against noriega and also 
against panama which has had a terrible track record in recent 
years delvalle said of his unsuccessful dismissal of the 
general i expect that the majority of the nations of this 
hemisphere will be very reluctant to have relations with panama

the league of women voters has rescheduled the 
march 5 debate among republican presidential candidates in 
nashville tenn to march 6 to avoid a conflict with the march 5 
south carolina primary a league spokeswoman said friday 
the new schedule means the gop debate will be on the same day as 
a previously scheduled democratic debate sponsored by the league 
we thought it would be better for the candidates if we 
scheduled the debate on sunday rather than on the day of the 
primary said league spokeswoman janice kaplan 
carole bucy president of the league of women voters in 
nashville said vice president george bush and sen bob dole of 
kansas had sent word they could not participate march 5 because of 
the conflict with the south carolina primary 
ms kaplan said rep jack kemp of new york is the only candidate 
so far to accept the leagues invitation for the gop debate march 
6 she said all six major contenders have agreed to participate in 
the democratic debate 
however spokesmen for the campaigns of missouri rep richard 
gephardt and massachusetts gov michael dukakis said they have not 
yet given a final commitment to join the league debate 
the republican debate will begin at 2 pm est while the 
democrats debate will start at 5 pm both of the debates will 
last an hour and will be at the tennessee performing arts center

new york gov mario cuomo said friday he 
wants no part of any brokered democratic national convention 
either as the presidential candidate or a kingmaker in selection of 
the partys nominee 
he said he still didnt believe there will be a deadlocked 
convention when the democrats gather in atlanta in july 
cuomo who announced a year ago that he wouldnt seek the 
democratic nomination has since refused to rule out accepting a 
convention draft 
his comments came as he prepared for trips during the next few 
days to north carolina and texas two of the march 8 super tuesday 
primary states 
i would have no role said cuomo of any brokered convention 
they the announced candidates would confine themselves to 
people who were candidates and talk to one another 
cuomo did say the possibility of a brokered convention came up 
in telephone conversations he had this week with among others 
former arizona gov bruce babbitt and illinois sen paul simon 
babbitt has quit the race for the presidential nomination while 
simon has cut back on his campaigning to concentrate on his home 
states march 15 primary 
i just asked them how they thought it would come out said 
cuomo they said it looks now like its open 
cuomo said that in discussing the situation neither simon nor 
babbitt had asked if cuomo might become a candidate at a brokered 
convention they know im not interested they know im out of 
this thing said cuomo 
cuomo repeated his view that a deadlocked convention is the 
worst thing that could happen to the democrats because it would 
hurt them in the november election 
was it coincidence that cuomo was heading south just before the 
super tuesday voting oh no thats a plan he joked you 
see im going to be march 1 in texas and if it really goes well 
then march 2 im going to announce im running

eric arturo delvalle called a puppet 
of gen manuel antonio noriega a few days ago may have lost the 
presidency but he has gained respect 
after 2 years in the obscurity of panamas presidency he went 
on television thursday and ordered noriega the man who is really 
in charge of the country to leave his post as military commander 
on one side of the contest was a man with high political office 
but no power on the other a man with no political office but 
control of the army navy air force police and national 
legislature 
a colonel delvalle appointed to succed noriega declined the job 
other officers rallied around their boss the national assembly 
convened for 10 minutes long enough to declare delvalle an 
expresident 
the legislatures action was unconstitutional delvalle said 
and the united states continued to recognize him as president but 
it was clear that he had lost 
delvalle 51 was the fifth president in six years of a nation 
whose presidents serve at the pleasure of the military he said he 
would take his case to the supreme court but acknowledged that his 
chances there were very slim because it also is controlled by 
general noriega 
even so he refused to relinquish the office i am the 
president of panama this morning he said friday 
by friday afternoon the two remaining numbers to the fiveline 
telephone system to delvalles residence were answered by a 
recording because of damage to the system the number you have 
dialed is being repaired the other three lines were cut thursday 
night 
delvalle was vice president in the fall of 1985 noriega moved 
him up after dismissing president nicolas ardito barletta for 
recommending an independent investigation into the death of one of 
the generals leading opponents hugo spadafora 
the dead mans relatives claim noriega was behind the killing 
spadaforas headless body was found stuffed in a canvas us mail 
bag in costa rica 
he had been threatening to offer proof of noriegas involvement 
in drug trafficking the same charge on which two federal grand 
juries in florida indicted the general earlier this month 
before becoming vice president in the 1984 election that 
opponents claim was rigged delvalle had not held public office he 
had spent most of most of his time since graduating from lousiana 
state university running a family sugar mill 
when asked friday whether he regretted getting into politics he 
said 
no not at all i think when you have an opportunity to serve 
your country and you believe you can you have to take the risks 
involved 
i discussed it fully with my family before running for vice 
president and we knew it would be a difficult task but i thought 
that i could help and maybe i could make the difference 
he shrugged and added i couldnt 
just last month retired gen ruben d paredes had urged 
delvalle to act the former panamanian military commander said the 
president should look at the tomb of his father be a man and do 
his part to tell noriega it was time to go

the leader of a puerto rican independence group 
and three sympathizers who plotted to spring him from prison with 
rockets grenade and a helicopter were sentenced to prison terms of 
up to 15 years friday 
those who take up the sword die by the sword us district 
judge william hart said in sentencing faln leader oscar lopez and 
the others 
lopez 45 drew 15 years in prison for masterminding the scheme 
to free himself and another inmate from the federal prison at 
leavenworth kan in 1986 the fbi infiltrated the plot almost 
from the beginning and broke it up 
lopezs codefendants received prison terms ranging from three 
to five years 
the conduct which has brought the defendants to this court is 
not their political beliefs the judge said 
in this country political beliefs are protected by the 
constitution but by planning a prison escape with explosives such 
conduct goes beyond that protection 
lopez was convicted of conspiracy in december along with 
grailing brown a fellow inmate and murderer dora garcia lopezs 
former sisterinlaw and jaime delgado a counselor at 
northeastern illinois university 
prosecutors said the group conspired to use rockets hand 
grenades and a helicopter to free lopez who was serving a 55year 
sentence for a 1981 seditiousconspiracy conviction he was 
transferred to another prison 
brown was sentenced to five years in prison delgado 34 
received four years and garcia 37 three years lopez had faced a 
maximum of 25 years in prison ms garcia and delgado faced 15 
years each and brown five 
defense attorneys had denied their clients engaged in violent 
acts 
lopez views himself as a freedom fighter above the law 
assistant us attorney daniel gillogly told the judge he 
provided the leadership and the direction of the conspiracy 
lopez believes human life is expendable said assistant us 
attorney deborah devaney 
lopez said friday that authorities and inmates at leavenworth 
had made threats against his life 
i do not deny that i love my people he told the judge i 
love my country puerto rico i will do anything necessary when an 
injustice is committed to fight it 
hart had planned to sentence the defendants at a closed hearing 
in the federal metropolitan correctional center because of 
outbursts by puerto rican activists at the defendants trial but 
later decided to do it in open court 
ms garcia made a plea for leniency friday but ms devaney 
dismissed her contention that she is generous and loving 
what compassion did she show for the guards at leavenworth who 
were going to be riddled with bullets the prosecutor asked 
faln is a spanish acronym for armed forces for national 
liberation the group seeks independence for puerto rico it has 
been linked to more than 100 bombings or planned bombings since 
1974 in chicago new york and elsewhere 
authorities say at least six people have died and 100 have been 
injured in faln violence in the united states

following are questions and answers 
about panamas importance to the united states and the dispute over 
the leadership of gen manuel antonio noriega 
q why is panama important to the united states 
a panama is vital to the united states both because of the 
panama canal linking the atlantic and pacific oceans and its 
strategic location 
access to the sshaped country is critical to control of the sea 
lanes in the caribbean as well as of links to south america and the 
far east from panama forces can be quickly deployed to central 
and south american points 
q is it that vital 
a yes the united states helped create panama by recognizing 
its independence when it seceded from colombia on nov 3 1903 and 
deployed the us navy to deter colombia from reconquering it the 
united states financed and built the canal owned it and ran it as 
a whollyowned us government company until president jimmy carter 
and panamanian leader omar torrijos signed treaties in 1977 that 
would hand ownership to panama 
q what is the canals status now 
a panama owns the canal which is administered by a joint 
uspanamanian commission complete administration control and 
defense of the waterway will be handed over to the panamanians by 
the year 2000 
the cartertorrijos treaties also abolished the panama canal 
zone a 10mile strip of land flanking the waterway that had been 
us territory us military forces in the southern command are 
allowed to remain in forts and bases to defend the zone 
q what does the southern command do 
a the us southern command has about 10000 officers and 
servicemen and coordinates all us military activity from south of 
the usmexico border to tierra del fuego in argentina and 
antarctica among other tasks it does contingency planning for the 
defense of latin america including training of latin american 
troops in antiguerrilla warfare part of that is carried out under 
provisions of the 1947 interamerican defense treaty 
q will the united states turn the canal over to panama 
a it has to if the treaties are to be respected although at 
the time carter signed the accords now president ronald reagan and 
other conservatives in the republican party opposed the move 
q could current troubles affect operation of the canal 
a since the unrest started last june there has been no 
disruption in operation of the canal officials say there is no 
cause for concern 
q why is the united states opposed to noriegas continued 
leadership 
a he had been considered useful at times in some intelligence 
operations but the mounting controversy over his purported 
involvement in illicit activities from drug trafficking to the 
assassination of political opponents has lost him credibility in 
washington 
his presence also runs counter to the trend toward civilian 
governments in latin america 
the united states wants a functioning democracy in place when 
the canal is turned over to panama to help ensure its security 
noriega maintains democracy already exists 
q how was president eric arturo delvalle ousted 
a delvalle fired noriega thursday evening hours later the 
legislature dominated by noriega supporters deposed delvalle in a 
10minute session it claimed he acted unconstitutionally in firing 
noriega the officer corps stood by noriega 
q have relations between panama and the united state been 
strained before 
a yes several times the last big confrontation was jan 9 
1964 when students rioted in a dispute over flying the panamanian 
flag alongside the stars and stripes in the canal zone this led to 
disputes over the then existing treaties governing the zone and 
eventually to the cartertorrijos negotiations 
q when did present tensions start 
a last june after noriegas recently retired second in 
command col roberto diaz herrera went public with charges of 
illicit activities the allegations had circulated for a long time 
but were never on record before from one of noriegas associates 
noriega denies the allegations and blames us rightists who 
oppose turning the canal over to panama for provoking the problems

ambassador vernon a walters said thursday 
the united states must pay the huge arrears in its share of the 
un budget or lose prestige and influence in the world body 
if the united states intends to use the united nations as an 
important tool of foreign policy in afghanistan the middle east 
and the iraniraq war then we must treat it as a serious 
institution he said 
walters permanent us representative at the united nations 
addressed the joint human rights and international organizations 
subcommittees of the house foreign affairs committee in washington 
on thursday his testimony was made available by the us mission 
america the largest un contributor now owes 252 million in 
regular budget assessments for several years the annual un 
budget is about 800 million of which the united states is 
expected to pay about 25 percent 
western sources said thursday that if congress continues to 
withhold un dues the embarrassed administration may seek a 
reduction of its budget contribution to the 159member 
organization no decision has been made 
the sources spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the united states has been withholding some of its dues since 
1985 in an effort to push for reforms in the united nations which 
us officials viewed as inefficient and biased against the united 
states 
us delinquency in its payments and its efforts to close the 
un mission of the palestine liberation organization have 
tarnished americas image in the organization the general assembly 
reconvenes monday in an emergency session on the plo dispute 
we cannot continue to neglect our financial commitments to the 
united nations and then expect that our opinions policies and 
positions will carry their former weight in the world body 
walters said 
the un is not a perfect organization politically or 
administratively from the us perspective nor will it ever be 
after all the world is hardly a perfect place we must work to 
improve the way the un serves our needs 
he and the reagan administration have been urging congress to 
restore full us funding for the united nations about 212 
million annually 
the united states said that as the largest donor it should 
have a greater voice in how its money was spent under the 
onenationonevote rule developing countries were dictating how 
us funds were spent and voting expenditures the united states 
opposed 
a policy of consensus was instituted in effect giving the 
united states veto power but it broke down in the general assembly 
session 
un member countries understood that this budget reform would 
be followed by a return by the us to full payment of our 
assessment walters testified 
he said implementation of the reforms was mixed and a key un 
committee last year was unable to agree on a budget ceiling and 
contingency fund as sought by the united states 
but he said us failure to pay even half of its un dues last 
year made other countries unwilling to move the new budget 
reform process forward 
the initial shock of us withholding created the impetus for 
reform walters said but reforms are unlikely to take full 
effect in an organization paralyzed by financial instability

ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
called friday night for a national strike to show that panamanians 
repudiate the leadership of gen manuel antonio noriega 
the general accused the united states of instigating delvalles 
failed effort on thursday to end his military rule and said 
washington waged a campaign of psychological warfare against 
him 
noriega addressed a rally of his supporters friday night and 
said panamanians who consider betrayal because they are born 
traitors meet a bad end here 
up to 10000 people attended the rally at the central garrison 
of the defense forces 
the noriegadominated national assembly turned delvalle out of 
office in a 10minute session early friday after the president 
tried to fire the armed forces chief following noriegas indictment 
in the united states as a drug trafficker 
noriega has denied all accusations against him 
the legislature named manuel solis palma the education 
minister as new president but delvalle insisted to reporters he 
was still president 
in washington the state department said it still recognized 
delvalle as panamas president 
delvalle told reporters friday night i dont have a seat of 
government nor military support but i do have two million 
panamanians who are tired of living under a regime that one man 
has governed capriciously and because of that i call for national 
resistance to paralyze the entire country starting monday 
the opposition national civic crusade on friday evening called 
for a progressive nationwide strike starting immediately 
aurelio barrilla president of the panamanian chamber of 
commerce and industry one of the groups in the coalition said the 
crusade was seeking total paralysis of the country by early 
next week 
however only one of several strikes called last summer by the 
coalition of about 200 organizations was notably successful and 
the government has shut down opposition newspapers radio and 
television stations limiting the crusades ability to spread its 
message 
in his address at the central garrison rally noriega said 
the defense forces offer subordination total support and our 
cooperation to the new president our best efforts to be able to 
reach presidential elections in may 1989 
panama is not a tribe he said the americans who live in 
panama should sleep easy because this people is not a tribe it is 
a healthy people 
panama a nation of 22 million people is headquarters for us 
military programs in latin america with the us southern command 
that has 10000 military personnel and their 20000 dependents in 
panama 
after the rally noriega walked with his supporters to the 
presidential offices about a mile away 
throughout the day there were fewer vehicles and people on the 
streets but panama city was calm and businesses operated normally 
delvalle said the protest strike would be peaceful saying i 
dont pretend to be the leader of the resistance i pretend to be 
the president who returns to the presidency he also urged a 
worldwide trade embargo against panama 
he called solis palma an opportunistic politician 
delvalles bid to remove noriega as head of panamas 
15000member defense forces was thwarted thursday night when the 
military closed ranks around the general and said no officer would 
replace him 
president reagan said the united states was not behind 
delvalles attempt to get rid of noriega but was very much aware 
of it he said there were no plans for military intervention 
the white house called on noriega to resign after he was 
indicted feb 5 in florida on drug trafficking charges noriega was 
accused of using his authority to let colombian drug traffickers 
utilize panama as a base for smuggling cocaine and marijuana into 
the united states the charges said noriega received kickbacks from 
drug profits 
soldiers on friday surrounded and closed the chamber of commerce 
building headquarters for the national civic crusade 
opponents of noriega met elsewhere to discuss actions to protest 
his rule 
police closed the offices of the christian democratic party 
whose president ricardo arias calderon has been a leader of the 
crusade movement 
arias calderon and a miami herald reporter andres oppenheimer 
were detained for two hours thursday night when they arrived on a 
commercial flight from miami oppenheimer was released but arias 
calderon was put on a flight to costa rica 
panamanian authorities refused entry to three american 
journalists when they tried to land early friday in a charter plane 
from costa rica 
miami herald central america correspondent sam dillon 
washington post correspondent julia preston and john siceloff a 
nicaraguabased producer for nbctv returned to costa rica 
the rally was noriegas first appearance in public since 
delvalle acted in an interview broadcast by the governments radio 
nacional earlier friday he said of the united states they have 
been using a web that includes psychological warfare slander 
lies injury conjecture and misinformation 
asked if there was us involvement in delvalles attempt to 
oust him noriega said totally they have maintained a web 
he said delvalle is in his home with his family without any 
problem 
relations between the reagan administration and noriega have 
deteriorated since june when opposition leaders launched a 
campaign of strikes and protests in panama to force the general out 
protests began after noriegas former second in command retired 
col roberto diaz herrera accused noriega of drug trafficking 
fraud and assassinating political opponents 
noriega issued a statement through his attorneys in miami in 
which he denounced us politicians he said advocate hysteria 
and act with a reckless disregard for the truth 
the statement also said all american interests in the 
republic are and shall remain undisturbed and unharmed it added 
these events are strictly internal to panama 
the panama canal operated normally friday 
american military personnel were on alert and civilians were 
told to keep a low profile 
the white house immediately offered its support after delvalle 
announced his intention to oust noriega but noriega and his 
supporters moved quickly against delvalle 
solis palma 71 will fill out the current presidential term 
which ends in october 1989 
the national assembly removed both delvalle and vice president 
roderick esquivel from office saying delvalle violated the law in 
trying to fire noriega

the soviet union will have its first international 
art auction in july when sothebys holds a sale of contemporary 
soviet works the americanowned auction house and soviet officials 
announced friday 
about 100 paintings by more than 20 contemporary soviet 
painters including some previously unofficial artists will go 
on the block july 7 at the international trade center in moscow 
said lord gowrie he is a former british arts minister and now 
chairman of the worlds largest auctioneering company 
i hope this will be the first of a series of auctions we 
chose sothebys because they have an international name sergei 
popov a senior official in the soviet ministry of culture told 
reporters at the news conference at sothebys headquarters 
it will be the soviets first international auction since the 
1917 revolution that brought the communists to power 
asked if the auctioned works would be by unofficial artists as 
well as those whose work is approved by the soviet union of 
artists popov replied there are no longer any unofficial 
artists for the past three years there have been no restrictions 
on any style or tendency in art 
popov said that when the works in the sale are given preview 
exhibitions in new york zurich london and paris you will see 
that all tendencies that flourish in the west are present in our 
art and some are perhaps better developed with us 
gowrie said the soviets placed no restrictions on what could be 
sold 
we have chosen what to sell and in the main they will be 
artists whose works are already well known in the west and of 
interest to collectors he said 
simon de pury sothebys managing director in europe said a 
large number of the artists represented in the sale were until 
recently regarded as unofficial artists 
among the contemporary artists with works in the sale are iliya 
kabakov ivan tschuikov and vadim zakharov there will also be some 
russian avant garde paintings of the 19101932 period 
gowrie said prices should range from about 3500 to 35000 and 
will have to be paid for in british pounds 
he said sothebys expects the sale total to be well over half 
a million pounds 880000 and the bulk of the money after the 
normal commissions will go to the artists he would not disclose 
sothebys commissions 
popov said the soviet government agreed to the auction because 
previous art sales to the west which started in 1967 were done 
through an export trade body 
thats not a very good way of entering the art market and this 
auction will help to establish prices on the international art 
market and allow soviet artists to receive the bulk of the 
proceeds popov said 
asked if the auction didnt run contrary to marxist principles 
gowrie said we had a good response from the artists themselves 
and i dont think 19th century philosophers were consulted 
popov said whats unmarxist about selling soviet art works 
so they become better known all over the world

a defense contractor executive who lost 
his job after criticizing the pentagons budget priorities filed 
suit thursday against the former secretary of the navy and three 
others accusing them of having him fired 
the suit by dr lawrence j korb filed in us district court 
here requests a jury trial and asks for a minimum of 500000 in 
compensatory damages as well as punitive damages for violating his 
first amendment right of free speech 
the suit names as plaintiffs former navy secretary john f 
lehman jr a former top aide melvyn r paisley assistant navy 
secretary everett pyatt and carl m smith a staffer with the 
senate armed services committee 
the lawsuit alleges the four men by complaining directly or 
indirectly to korbs bosses at the raytheon co intended to and 
did penalize dr korb for exercising the right of free speech 
guaranteed to him by the first amendment of the constitution 
as a direct and proximate result of the defendants acts dr 
korb has sustained and will continue to sustain substantial 
monetary losses and has suffered and will continue to suffer mental 
and emotional pain anguish and humiliation the suit says 
the suit was filed on korbs behalf by the american civil 
liberties union which in 1986 had asked thendefense secretary 
caspar w weinberger to fire lehman and his aides for their conduct 
weinberger instead admonished the three 
efforts to contact lehman and the other defendants thursday were 
unsuccessful 
korb who worked for weinberger for four years as the pentagons 
assistant defense secretary for manpower joined raytheon a major 
navy contractor as a washington vice president in 1985 with the 
companys permission he also joined the committee for national 
security a bipartisan group that seeks to encourage informed 
debate on national security issues 
in february 1986 korb appeared with other group members at a 
press conference and suggested the pentagon could maintain its 
strength with a smaller budget than that requested by president 
reagan 
following the news conference raytheon received phone calls and 
letters from paisley and pyatt 
the two lehman deputies have acknowledged calling raytheon and 
suggesting korb be told to stop speaking out against the 
presidents budget the pentagons inspector general in an earlier 
investigation concluded lehman had not directed pyatt and paisley 
to call raytheon but clearly supported his deputies actions 
korbs suit says raytheon also was contacted about the same time 
by smith a senate committee staffer who oversaw missile budgets 
affecting raytheon 
on information and belief defendant smith told them that 
unless raytheon silenced or removed dr korb he smith would no 
longer meet with anyone from raytheons washington office the 
suit says 
in direct and immediate reaction to the angry complaints and 
explicit and implicit threats made by defendants lehman pyatt 
paisley and smith raytheon terminated dr korb as vice president 
in charge of its washington operations 
korb is now the dean of the university of pittsburghs graduate 
school of public and international affairs 
the suit filed thursday is similar to one filed in december by 
korb against raytheon ratheon has responded that it didnt fire 
korb but offered him a transfer to another job that he declined to 
accept korb has said he considered the offered job would have been 
a demotion

president reagan said friday he has no plan to 
intervene militarily in panama as us officials scrambled to 
assess a precarious position brought on in part by federal 
drugsmuggling indictments of strong man gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
but the state department said the united states will continue to 
recognize eric arturo delvalle as president of panama despite a 
parliamentary vote to oust him and replace him with manuel solis 
palma who has been education minister 
the national assembly moved against delvalle after he tried to 
dismiss noriega who was indicted by federal grand juries in miami 
and tampa fla earlier this month 
amid the continuing political instability vice president george 
bush said the united states should do whatever is necessary to 
protect american interests in the central american country which 
include the militarily and economically vital panama canal 
noriegas gone bad and hes proven hes trafficked in 
narcotics bush said noriega should go and in my view he 
will go 
reagan said he didnt think there was any appetite on the part 
of anyone there including mr noriega to take on our troops 
responding to questions during a picturetaking session with 
southern republican party leaders the president said the united 
states did not instigate delvalles move thursday but he also said 
us officials had been very much aware of it 
asked whether the united states was contemplating military 
intervention there the president replied no i dont think 
thats an answer he declined to discuss other alternatives 
saying were not prepared to come up with any answers as yet 
reagan said he thought there are some limits on what we can 
do but that were looking at that situation and our people 
are meeting on it to see if theres anything we can do 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier there was no 
administration interest in a proposal by sen alfonse damato 
rny to impose trade sanctions against panama 
late friday following a series of meetings involving national 
security officials fitzwater issued a statement saying that we 
condemn all efforts to perpetuate military rule in panama 
including efforts to remove president delvalle from office 
the statement said we have also initiated a series of 
consultations to learn the views of other countries in in the 
hemisphere with regard to this situation 
bush campaigning to succeed reagan seemed to take a harder 
line during a talk to a greenville sc audience 
he told the south carolina press association we will do 
whatever is necessary to protect american interests in panama 
weve got treaty interests on the panama canal i dont want to 
rattle any sabers 
but we would obviously as the united states and i would 
reserve the right to do whatever is necessary including military 
force to protect americas sacred interest in that region of the 
world bush said 
he stopped short of calling for military intervention however 
saying the united states past history of intervention in latin 
american affairs is whats hurting us in some areas now some 
10000 american troops are stationed in panama 
one of bushs rivals for the republican nomination senate 
minority leader bob dole of kansas said during a campaign stop in 
st louis that the united states has had enough of noriega and 
will have nothing to do with any phony civilian noriegapuppet 
government 
dole warned the panamian strong man if you think you can put 
the heat on us by meddling around with the canal we will do 
whatever is necessary including the use of military force to 
protect our security interests and the lives of american citizens 
from capitol hill the administration got conflicting advice on 
how to handle the situation 
senate democrats urged caution while damato advocated the 
trade embargo and sen jesse helms rnc called noriega a 
bum and said he ought to be thrown out 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said the united 
states ought to keep cool and make haste slowly to give the 
panamanian people ample time to decide noriegas fate 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said washington should proceed with great caution 
in consultation with neighboring nations to protect us national 
interests in panama 
rep dante fascell chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee said the united states should strongly support delvalle 
and that other nations in the region should do the same 
fascell dfla said the united states should increase 
diplomatic pressure immediately and added at this point we 
certainly should be reviewing our options in the economic area 
fitzwater confirmed that delvalle had held talks at the us 
embassy in panama city before moving to oust noriega on thursday 
but he denied that the administration had lent any encouragement to 
the panamanian president 
theres not a lot that we can say about impressions the 
spokesman said the united states has a large interest there 
obviously but we have tried to walk the line between whats 
appropriate and whats not appropriate 
we have a precarious position fitzwater added yes we 
want him noriega to stand trial on the miami indictment yes 
we want civilian government in panama but we want to be careful 
not to unduly intrude upon the affairs of panama 
at the state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley reiterated 
what she termed our support for the supremacy of civilian 
constitutional rule and said we continue to recognize president 
delvalle as the president of panama 
asked to describe the legal grounds for such recognition she 
said i dont think its for us to interpret their constitutional 
law we had regarded him as the president we still regard him as 
the president 
mrs oakley also said the united states continues to recognize 
juan b sosa as panamas ambassador in washington sosa has 
supported delvalle and he said he planned to remain in his post 
although noriega told him by telephone friday morning that he would 
be replaced 
mrs oakley said elliott abrams the assistant secretary of 
state for interamerican affairs met with sosa on friday but she 
wouldnt reveal details of the discussion 
asked if the united states had been in contact with noriega she 
said not that im aware of 
many people knew that we had been aware of the actions that 
president delvalle was contemplating doing the spokeswoman said 
we had been informed that the decision was president delvalles 
own to make 
reagan canceled a scheduled weekend visit to his camp david 
md mountaintop retreat but fitzwater said it was because of a 
scheduled social event at the white house on sunday afternoon and 
not because of the panamanian crisis 
fitzwater said that while delvalle had been in contact with 
state department officials before thursdays illfated attempt to 
oust noriega we did not urge him to take this action he did it 
on his own 
the spokesman also said he saw no immediate need for any 
dramatic moves by the united states to protect citizens and 
military forces in panama 
panamanian authorities advise us there is no threat to 
americans in that country he said

arizonas supreme court on friday refused 
to delay the start of gov evan mechams immpeachment trial on 
monday but did not rule out blocking the proceedings later 
the ruling came in an emergency session during which the 
governors lawyers cited danger to his constitutional rights and 
the justices expressed concern about breaching the separation of 
judicial and legislative powers 
the high court said it would decide on tuesday one day after 
the senate trial is to begin whether to issue an injunction 
against it 
in another development mechams chief attorney has withdrawn 
from mechams case 
thomas crowe another attorney for the firstterm republican 
had told the high court that mechams rights would be violated if 
an impeachment trial were held before related criminal charges were 
heard in court 
but john lundin representing the senate told the justices they 
were being asked to enter an arena that has never been entered 
into by any court in this nation and suggested they refrain from 
breaking such new ground 
the justices indicated by questions that they were reluctant to 
interfere with legislative matters in light of the state 
constitutions separation of powers 
i dont think one can say that fundamental rights of fair play 
dont apply to impeachment proceedings but who decides what is 
fair play isnt it the senate that decides what the rules are 
said vice chief justice stanley feldman 
feldman said he believed that the framers of the constitution 
wanted to keep us out of matters involving legislative bodies 
feldman presided in place of chief justice frank x gordon who 
has removed himself from such matters because he will preside over 
the impeachment trial 
meanwhile the arizona civil liberties union filed a 
friendofthecourt brief arguing that mechams right to a fair 
trial on criminal charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
would be violated if the senate proceeding were held first 
we are taking no position on the impeachment said aclu 
lawyer alice bendheim but we are asking that the state supreme 
court ensure that governor mecham gets due process 
senators who previously delayed the trials start a week 
refused earlier this week to give crowe and washington attorney 
jerris leonard more time to prepare the governors defense 
mecham was impeached feb 5 on a 4614 house vote several days 
later the house approved 23 impeachment articles the equivalent of 
an indictment in a criminal case they outlined details of three 
broad charges against the firstterm republican that he concealed 
a 350000 loan to his 1986 campaign misused 80000 from the 
governors protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership and 
tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a 
state official 
murray miller who has represented mecham since october 
withdrew from the case abruptly saying friday that he decided late 
thursday night to drop out 
he said leonard was now in charge of the defense but he 
expressed uncertainty at whether leonard who was hired by the 
governor tuesday could be prepared to proceed on monday 
however leonard said i think evan mecham is entitled to the 
best representation he can get i dont say this braggadociously at 
all but if he feels he wants me he should be entitled to have the 
lawyer of his choice 
miller declined to elaborate on his reasons for bowing out but 
he said he hoped senators would not suspect he had deceived them 
about his role in the case as late as wednesday night he saidi 
was fully in charge of the case and defending the governor 
senate majority leader robert usdane a republican said he 
suspected the change of lawyers was planned and was a delaying 
tactic by mecham 
anything to try and tie this thing up until may 17th he 
said referring to the date when the republican governor faces a 
recall election we are not going to do that 
senate minority leader alan stephens a democrat said i see 
no reason to delay 
i think it is absolutely disgusting and an outrage said 
assistant minority leader lela alston i think its part of the 
governors strategy to continue delays 
miller denying any devious actions said my main concern is 
that the governor gets a fair legal shake 
mecham did not immediately return a telephone call friday from 
the associated press but the arizona daily star of tucson on 
friday quoted him as saying murray withdrew from the case we 
parted friendly but thats really all youll have to ask him 
why 
impeachment prosecutor william french said miller will be 
required to submit a motion on monday seeking senate permission to 
withdraw from the case french said he may oppose the motion if he 
believes millers withdrawal might be used for a later claim that 
the new attorneys did not have time to prepare for the trial 
leonard was in his office but sent word through a secretary that 
he was too busy to talk to a reporter who visited his office friday 
leonard has resigned from the washington law firm of manatt 
phelps rothenberg tunney and evans because of his decision to 
represent mecham said charles t manatt a senior partner in the 
firm 
jerris leonard informed the firm last week that he had been 
contacted by governor mecham concerning representation said 
manatt we made it clear that the firm was not interested in 
representing governor mecham and mr leonard informed us that he 
has resigned from the firm 
manatt a former chairman of the democratic national committee 
was asked why his firm wasnt interested in being associated with 
the mecham case lots of reasons you can well imagine he 
replied 
the beleaguered mecham also faces a a march 22 criminal trial on 
charges of concealing the 350000 campaign loan miller has 
dropped out of that case too 
miller had repeatedly pleaded to have the criminal trial heard 
first contending that widely publicized senate proceedings would 
prejudice potential jurors 
senators have voiced suspicions that mecham wanted to fight for 
his job in the recall election before the senate trial because the 
senate has the power to bar him from ever holding public office 
again if he is convicted

government officials said 2134 
prisoners were released saturday and 5100 others had their prison 
terms reduced or civic rights restored under a grand amnesty 
the officials said 125 political dissidents were among those 
freed and 1606 dissidents were among those granted other forms of 
leniency the rest were common criminals 
it was the first public gesture of conciliation by the 
government of president rohtaewoo who was installed thursday in 
the first peaceful transfer of power since south koreas 
independence in 1948 
culture and information minister chung hanmo announced the 
amnesty friday he said it was meant to promote national harmony 
and restore public confidence in the roh government 
the political opposition and dissidents however said the 
amnesty was not enough and expressed regret that many leading 
dissidents were not included 
the divided opposition agreed friday to join ranks after months 
of bitter squabbling the two parties decided to unite to oppose 
the roh government in upcoming national assembly elections 
the rival opposition leaders issued a joint announcement saying 
we have agreed to form a new integrated party by the end of next 
week 
the agreement calls for kim youngsams reunification democratic 
party and the kim daejungs party for peace and democracy to merge 
into a new opposition party to be named later 
in a news conference saturday kim daejung called for total 
amnesty he complained that the number of political prisoners 
released constituted a small portion of the total of 1300 
political detainees he called on the government to free all but 
those who profess themselves to be communists 
lee tonmyung a leading dissident and human rights lawyer said 
the amnesty was a sham and showed roh was the extension of 
his authoritarian predecessor chun doohwan 
prosecution authorities claimed that 276 political detainees 
remain 216 awaiting trial and 60 serving sentences but considered 
unrepentant involved in serious crimes such as murder or arson 
the prosecution hinted that some of those awaiting trial might be 
freed later when judicial processes are completed 
among released political prisoners were seven student leaders 
involved in seizing the us cultural center in seoul in may 1985 
some prominent dissidents including the rev moon ikhwan and 
poet ko eun who were already out of jail had their civic rights 
restored 
meanwhile several major questions remained unanswered about the 
opposition merger including power distribution the two parties 
have been bitter rivals and their past unification attempts have 
failed 
the division was formed after both kim youngsam and kim 
daejung insisted on running in the dec 16 presidential election 
the two kims who split the oppostion vote lost to roh the ruling 
party candidate 
roh was elected with 366 percent of the vote

the hierarchy of jimmy swaggarts church 
said friday it will ask church officials in louisiana to reconsider 
their proposed threemonth suspension of the tv evangelist accused 
of sexual misconduct 
g raymond carlson general superintendent of the 
springfieldbased assemblies of god refused to say what penalty 
the church recommended instead 
however the churchs executive presbytery had met here to 
consider a tougher penalty after many members called the church 
headquarters to complain that the suspension of the 
fireandbrimstone evangelist too lenient 
cbs reported friday that the assemblies of god told louisiana 
leaders to order swaggart who tearfully confessed to unspecified 
sins from his pulpit sunday to step down a year the network cited 
no sources for the report 
assemblies of god spokeswoman juleen turnage late friday said 
she did not know what the church had recommended and could not 
confirm the report louisiana district superintendent cecil janway 
was not home friday night said his wife 
carlson announced the decision after 11 hours of discussion over 
two days with other members of the executive presbytery other 
board members refused comment friday 
the home district of the baton rouge la evangelist 
recommended earlier this week that swaggart be barred from 
preaching for three months and undergo two years of rehabiliation 
and counseling 
once the louisiana district has reviewed the swaggart case the 
executive presbytery will take it up again carlson said a final 
decision on these matters could be several days or weeks away 
carlson said 
although swaggart and church officials never specified the 
evangelists sin an admitted prostitute said in interviews this 
week that she had performed lewd acts for swaggart for about a year 
church officials say no other minister accused of moral 
misconduct has been allowed to return to preaching in so short a 
time as three months and questions were raised about the financial 
support the louisiana district receives from jimmy swaggart world 
ministries 
two officials of the state district general superintendent 
cecil janway also a member of swaggarts evangelical enterprise 
and forrest hall the treasurer met with the executive presbytery 
on thursday louisiana district officials had no comment friday 
turnage said earlier that if the executive presbytery disagreed 
with the louisiana districts recommendations it would pass on its 
concerns to the lower body and ask officials in louisiana to 
reconsider 
mrs turnage said the churchs constitution made the 
disciplinary process a lengthy one she said this has been 
frustrating for church members who have flooded headquarters with 
calls expressing their concern 
it just continues to hang there in the forefront of everyones 
mind she said 
mrs turnage added that officials want to conclude the matter as 
soon as possible and get out of the public spotlight 
it is the second time in a year that the assemblies of god the 
nations largest pentecostal denomination considered disciplinary 
measures against a prominent minister caught in a scandal last 
year ptl founder jim bakker lost his assemblies credentials after 
it was disclosed that he had had sex with a woman other than his 
wife and then tried to pay her to keep silent bakker rejected a 
rehabilitation proposal 
swaggart who reaches around the world with broadcast sermons 
and contributes 12 million a year to the foreign missions programs 
of the assemblies of god stepped down from his pulpit sunday after 
confessing to an undisclosed sin 
he has not appeared in public since then and was not at the 
closed meetings here 
mrs turnage said the swaggart case is the most complex ever for 
the executive presbytery because of the many facets of swaggarts 
ministry 
swaggart records gospel albums bible study tapes and television 
tapes and takes his ministry abroad 
the problem according to mrs turnage is deciding what is 
preaching 
in the past preaching meant going into the pulpit she said 
but with swaggart is his singing going to be considered 
preaching i dont know

the federal communications commission voted 
thursday to explore the possibility of creating a national radio 
channel with a single entity guiding the operations of the channel 
on a nationwide basis 
such a channel could be carved from a new set of am broadcasting 
services in the 1605 to 1705 kilohertz range at the upper edge of 
the am band these frequencies could accommodate about 10 channels 
in a band for which receivers are not yet available 
the fcc voted to open its fourth inquiry on the expanded band to 
get comment on this proposal and others on use of the new channels 
in preparation for an international telecommunications union 
conference in june where the issue will be discussed the itu a 
unit of the united nations coordinates use of the electromagnetic 
spectrum 
the fcc said that while it is keeping open the option of 
licensing the additional channels in its traditional way it also 
said it will explore national licensing of frequencies in the 
expanded band 
under this approach a single entity would be able to guide 
the development of a channel on a nationwide basis such a national 
licensee could operate the stations itself or could lease the 
frequency to others the fcc said 
the commission said such a concept could have several 
advantages including economies of scale 
commissioner patricia diaz dennis said that while the idea was 
creative it would face a number of regulatory hurdles 
including the commissions multiple ownership rules

afghanistans communist government 
said thursday a guerrilla proposal for an interim government while 
soviet troops withdraw was a hysterical dream but a us envoy 
called it a good idea 
undersecretary of state michael armacost visiting pakistan 
said the plan announced this week by the sevenparty guerrilla 
alliance was a very welcome step toward the resolution of the 
afghan problem 
the alliance led by yunis khalis and based in pakistan 
proposes an executive council of all seven guerrilla leaders to 
preside over a 28member cabinet of rebels afghan refugees and 
moslems presently living in kabul 
soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 and 
an estimated 115000 now are in the country helping fight the 
guerrillas 
about 35 million afghans have fled to neighboring pakistan 
most live in border cities and camps that serve as bases and supply 
points for the guerrillas 
thursdays editions of the afghan communist party newspaper anis 
said the plan resembles more a hysterical and disturbed dream 
kabul radio reported 
it is clear that this void and unfounded plan has no 
legitimacy and therefore is unacceptable the paper said adding 
that the insurgent proposal was like the story of sharing the 
wolfs prey 
the radio also broadcast a foreign ministry statement that 
there is only one legal government in afghanistan which has been 
recognized by 80 countries in the world 
armacost arrived wednesday to discuss progress toward soviet 
withdrawal he met with president mohammed zia ulhaq and a us 
embassy official said he also had frank and open discussions 
with leaders of the moslem guerrillas 
mikhail s gorbachev said feb 8 that soviet troops will start 
pulling out may 15 if unsponsored talks in geneva between 
afghanistan and pakistan bring a settlement by march 15 and 
complete the withdrawal in 10 months the talks are to resume 
wednesday 
pakistan demands a military settlement be accompanied by a 
political one to ensure transitional stability washington which 
supports the guerrillas has devoted most of its effort to 
obtaining a withdrawal

a major obstacle to oil and gas drilling 
below the scenic bluffs at pacific palisades on the los angeles 
coast was removed thursday when the state supreme court rejected an 
appeal by environmentalists 
the unanimous vote of the six justices participating clears the 
way for occidental petroleum corp which first applied for a 
permit in 1970 to begin exploratory drilling within a few months 
unless another court intervenes 
occidental is obviously very pleased said arthur groman 
senior member of the companys board this field which we think 
may be as much as 60 million barrels of oil is a vital resource of 
the united states 
attorney roger diamond who represented two residents 
challenging the drilling and is a board member the environmental 
group no oil inc said opponents will ask a los angeles judge next 
week to block the drilling while a challenge to the projects 
coastal commission permit is pending 
the supreme court now is less environmentally concerned than 
it used to be said diamond noting that the court had blocked a 
version of the palisades project in 1974 
the court refused to hear an appeal of a lowercourt ruling 
upholding the citys 1985 approval of the drilling project justice 
stanley mosk whose son richard is one of occidentals lawyers 
did not participate in the ruling 
occidental plans to seek quick city approval of a water drainage 
system to stabilize the cliffs site of a destructive 1957 
landslide drilling could then begin 
opponents suffered a setback monday when a los angeles city 
council panel voted 32 against withdrawing city approval of the 
project 
occidental has estimated that 25 million to 60 million barrels 
of oil and 50 billion to 120 billion cubic feet of natural gas can 
be found 10000 feet below ground at the site opponents have 
called the estimates inflated and speculative

the state since 1980 said william miernyk a retired economist 
at west virginia university 
this accounts for about 15 percent of the states labor force 
he said it also tends to distort the unemployment picture in west 
virginia a chronically poor state where three of every five 
residents live in rural areas 
rural places throughout the south and appalachia have found 
themselves left out of the economic boom in many of the metro areas 
the federal government currently lists west virginias jobless 
rate at 74 percent with many rural counties reporting 
doubledigit unemployment 
id say the true unemployment rate around here counting 
people who have used up their benefits would be way over 20 
percent said john duck dudash a retired miner at 
farmington a little coal town in northern west virginia 
things are so bad that people would line up for miles double 
file if a mine around here would start hiring why it reminds me 
of the depression said the 74yearold dudash farmington is 
almost a ghost town these days 
miernyk went further in some ways its worse than it was in 
the 1930s 
coal has always been a cyclic industry here but in recent 
years weve lost many thousands of coal mining jobs that because 
of the decline of our chemical and primary metals industries well 
never get back 
the loss of these industrial payrolls plus the erosion of 
nearly 25 percent of west virginias manufacturing jobs has had a 
ripple effect on the state economy even traditional revenue 
sources such as the stateoperated liquor stores are reporting 
serious revenue losses these days 
in december standard amp poors a national bondrating service 
imposed an emergency financial watch on the state 
last month the kanawha county school system west virginias 
largest threatened to close down then filed suit in an attempt to 
force the state to pay millions of dollars in overdue schoolaid 
payments 
the state needs an immediate 150 million fix just to stay 
even farley said on top of that well probably need another 
50 million by the end of the fiscal year given that tax revenues 
currently are 37 million below budget estimates 
farley doubts gov arch moore jrs recent assertion that the 
state merely has a cash flow problem which will clear up when 
logjammed tax revenues come rolling in 
moore a republican imposed a 20 percent acrosstheboard 
spending freeze during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that 
ended last june 30 despite the freeze he still had to withhold 
58 million in state income tax refunds until after june 30 
this meant we began the current fiscal year 58 million in the 
hole farley said 
as of midfebruary west virginia was 100 million behind in 
schoolaid payments it owed 50 million in state medical insurance 
payments to hospitals physicians and pharmacists and it needed to 
come up with about 30 million as its share of 120 million in 
overdue federalstate medicaid payments 
meanwhile the states teachers are up in arms because their 
paychecks are threatened and their retirement fund is more than 1 
billion in the red due to past borrowing from it by the state 
some state officials acknowledge privately that many smaller 
companies no longer will do business with the government except on 
a cash basis 
moore who is seeking reelection acknowledged in november the 
state was facing a financial crisis a month later in his 
stateofthestate address he said west virginia had just 
experienced a great year of economic development 
state senate president dan tonkovich a democrat who also is 
running for governor accused moore of fomenting chaos 
standard amp poors in its financial warning about 900 million 
worth of state bonds noted neither the executive nor 
legislative branches has formulated a comprehensive program to 
address the states deteriorating financial picture 
west virginians whose motto is mountaineers are always 
free say they are depressed and frightened 
i feel the thing that has really pushed us over the edge is 
the loss of federal revenue sharing funds said kate long a 
citizen activist who is knowledgeable about the states tax 
structure weve always had inept politicians and cycles of boom 
and bust but a poor state like west virginia simply cant overcome 
the loss of 200 million a year given everything else that has 
happened to us 
a study by the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees shows west virginia over the past four years 
has lost more federal dollars per capita than any other state 
except new york the money lost when federal revenue sharing was 
curtailed took 23 percent of west virginia communities annual 
budgets and caused widespread service cutbacks

in rural preston county county hospital administrator hilda 
heady said she has had to impose a 20 percent layoff and other 
cutbacks such as reduced operating room hours in order to keep 
the doors open 
jerry ash a spokesman for the west virginia hospital 
association said continuing revenue losses and especially late 
payments by the state have created a medical care crisis 
two small hospitals went bankrupt last year and we did a 
recent survey that showed six more of the states 35 small rural 
hospitals are on the verge of bankruptcy another six are just a 
step behind them he said 
farley who advocates a combination of budget cuts and tax 
increases to try and stave off financial disaster said a national 
energy policy is needed to help states such as west virginia 
louisiana and texas whose economies have been crippled by erosion 
of natural resourcebased industries 
asked what west virginia would do if it did go belly up farley 
just shook his head 
the governor when asked recently what would happen should west 
virginia be unable to pay its bills in april replied by quipping 
who says there will even be a state government by then 
but the question is no joke to many west virginians and 
especially thys out for the 
poor in pahokee long bypassed by the opportunity burgeoning in 
other parts of florida 
pahokee high school with 150 male students now enrolled has 
26 graduates attending college on football scholarships many hope 
to follow the lead of jackson who returns here in the offseason 
and pahokee alumnus andre waters now a safety for the national 
football leagues philadelphia eagles 
football coach don thompson said 34 players from the high school 
have earned scholarships in the past 4 years 
thats a million dollars worth of education said the coach 
few could afford the schooling otherwise in a town where no 
college means joining the armed forces or a life of seasonal 
agricultural work 
economic statistics are imprecise but average family income in 
pahokee ranges between 12500 and 15000 compared to 38000 
statewide floridas unemployment rate is only 49 percent there 
are no reliable unemployment figures for pahokee because most work 
is seasonal 
in pahokee a few families are filthy rich and some people 
are dirt poor said warren nevad city finance director 
while floridas population has grown to 12 million from 5 
million in 1960 pahokees has fallen below 7000 people for the 
first time since the depression when it hit 15000 
nearly 45 percent of the residents are black many of them 
young the median age is 262 years 
rural towns in many parts of the nation but especially in the 
south have seen their fortunes and numbers decline in recent 
years as farming and small manufacturing employment have dropped 
and people have migrated to cities for opportunity 
pahokees history tells a peculiar tale of decline but 
recently too of hope for a new start 
country singer mel tillis who left his hometown in 1951 
recalls a huckleberry finntom sawyer existence in his boyhood 
pahokees living history book 92yearold carmen salvatore 
remembers that when he arrived in 1919 he found the land like god 
made it 
that was before this part of the everglades was drained the 
only way to get to pahokee was by boat 
the wildlife was in abundance salvatore said the lake 
was filled with fish there were birds of every kind we had plenty 
of beans and fresh vegetables 
but powerful financial political and natural forces threatened 
that bucolic lifestyle 
sugar corporations moved in after fidel castros communist 
revolution in cuba three decades ago and the subsequent end in us 
purchases of cuban sugar 
the dark rich everglades muck around giant lake okeechobee was 
bought up from small farmers and converted from winter vegetable 
fields by us sugar corp and smaller companies to grow cane some 
450000 acres around the lake produce 1 billion in sugar each year 
its at harvest time when the fields are torched to burn off 
leaves and drive out snakes and other animals that the rabbit runs 
bring a burst of activity in the quiet town which has no night 
spots or community center for teenagers 
we dont have jobs thats the way we have to get some 
money said willie littlejohn an allstate sophomore defensive 
tackle at the high school the rabbits bring 125 to 2 apiece 
the likes of littlejohn can bring home 10 to 20 a day 
salvatore recalls a thriving pahokee during prohibition 
bootleggers flocked to the isolated town on boats full of homemade 
south florida booze destined for chicago speakeasies 
in the late 1920s hurricanes and floods washed away precious 
topsoil and then the great depression hit 
even then pahokees low cost of living salvatore a father of 
five recalls getting by on 9 a month and plentiful work in the 
vegetable fields increased the population to 15000 
pahokee became one of south floridas upandcoming towns a 
native was elected speaker of the statehouse the towns political 
clout led to roads schools and everything else pahokee seemed to 
need 
we had high hopes salvatore said sitting on his porch as a 
morning breeze delivered a sugary scent from nearby fields 
like so many pioneers we had all the trials and tribulations 
then someone else came in and reaped the benefits he said 
referring to recent shifts in the labor force 
the sugar industry requires less labor than previous 
agriculture and most harvesting is done now by west indians 
imported under a special immigration agreement 
desegregation in the 1960s meant more change many white 
families sent their children away to private school or moved out 
salvatore whose grandson carmen iii is police chief details 
the dozens of stores restaurants motels and even barbershops that 
have closed 
he predicts pahokee will shrivel but he seems to be in the 
minority 
people are saying i like this town and im going to take a 
stand said james bennett a funeral home operator who just 
completed four years as president of the chamber of commerce 
its not the style of people here to talk publicly about one 
major reason for change the death 1 years ago at age 80 of mayor 
duncan uncle dunc padgett who ran the city for 25 years 
uncle dunc dominated pahokee and was determined to protect 
it from the onslaught of florida growth 
those who run the city now say pahokee had become a textbook for 
how not to run a city water meters werent read for years and the 
city was paying 69000 a year to insure a fleet of vehicles many 
no longer in service 
the city council of uncle dunc rebelled in the 1970s against 
federal regulations that found water sewerage and housing were not 
up to minimum standards 
at one point pahokee city council voted to secede from the 
union 
todays council is more pragmatic 
mayor clark wilkinson was elected last year on a reform platform 
and she helped gain 31 passage of a feb 9 referendum changing the 
city government from the strong mayor system to a city manager 
running a professional city government 
this has turned the city around 100 percent said councilman 
ramon horta the first hispanic ever on the fivemember council 
roy singletary last year became the first black on council 
the mayor followed the city charter referendum with a series of 
meetings among more than 50 residents and researchers from state 
universities to look at pahokees needs 
they are working out plans to develop fishingbased tourism 
improve housing and lure new businesses 
said city council president john norman we love pahokee and 
were going to keep it alive

the urgent need to boost employment in the 
depressed rural south is a point on which democratic and republican 
presidential candidates agree but to create jobs in the hardhit 
region they take different routes this the last story in a 
fourpart series looking at rural poverty details the candidates 
proposals from training and basic education to rural enterprise 
zones and increased wages and farm prices 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most of the presidential candidates agree that 
new jobs are the key to combating poverty especially in the rural 
south but their proposals for creating them differ widely from 
minimum wage revisions to education enterprise zones and saving 
the family farm 
responding to a survey by the associated press on how to deal 
with rural poverty democrats jesse jackson and gary hart both 
pushed an increase in the 335anhour minimum wage while 
republican pat robertson said there should be a subminimum youth 
opportunity wage to help teenagers break into the job market 
the republicans in general stressed economic development vice 
president george bush said rural america has been strongly tested 
in recent years but is headed back up 
bushs chief rival senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
said that as a disabled war veteran i am sensitive to the needs 
of people who due to factors beyond their control may need a 
boost in climbing the ladder of opportunity 
dole said he would change the formula for funding poverty 
programs that he said discriminate against rural america 
both bush and rep jack kemp of new york suggest rural 
enterprise zones robertson said education is the turnkey to 
resolve poverty in the south 
among the democrats sen albert gore jr of tennessee who is 
hoping to score heavily in his home region during the super tuesday 
primaries march 8 said our greatest defense against poverty is 
education 
rep richard gephardt of missouri said his trade agricultural 
and competitiveness initiatives will restore economic health to 
rural america 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis said every distressed area in 
america urban or rural could benefit from the same development 
and welfare reform policies that have worked in his state 
including job training for welfare recipients and publicprivate 
development partnerships 
jackson said the cornerstone of antipoverty policy is full 
employment at adequate wages he called for a national floor on 
welfare payments universal national health care and a commitment 
to save the family farm 
sen paul simon dill said day care was vital for the rural 
poor he said his public works program would give people a better 
opportunity than welfare or unemployment benefits and he pledged 
to bring farm prices back up 
the associated press asked all the presidential candidates on 
feb 11 to respond to the following question 
the census bureau reports that in 1986 when the national 
poverty rate was 136 percent the poverty rate in the south was 
161 percent more than 13 million or 40 percent of the nations 
32 million poor people live in the south as president how would 
you deal with poverty in general and rural poverty in particular 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
here is how the democrats replied 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in massachusetts we have made opportunity for all a 
fundamental economic goal we have reduced unemployment from nearly 
12 percent in 1975 to three percent today our et education 
and training choices program has helped more than 40000 
massachusetts residents lift themselves from public assistance to 
real jobs and the massachusetts housing partnership has helped 
provide decent and affordable housing for 30000 families of low 
and moderate income with thousands more in the pipeline 
america can and must do the same through a strong national 
urban policy and a parallel commitment to regional development we 
can bring to every distressed area and to every region rural or 
urban the opportunity to combine public investment with private 
resources and create new jobs 
through national welfare reform we can make the success of et 
a nationwide success and with a national partnership for 
affordable housing one that combines a renewed federal commitment 
with the sensitivity of local initiative we can end the national 
disgrace of homelessness and provide affordable housing for working 
people the poor and the elderly

the missouri congressman said welfare benefits should be high 
enough to bring poor families up to the poverty line welfare 
programs must be reformed to give people the skills and 
experience they need to leave welfare and poverty behind and 
provide preschool education for their children at age 3 
gephardt supports higher medicare prepayment rates for rural 
hospitals and federal efforts to strengthen both our 
infrastructure and our transportation system in rural areas 
to spur rural development gephardt will utilize the expertise 
of local governments rural electric and telephone cooperatives 
cooperative extension through land grant universities and the 
private sector to help communities build their own economic 
development strategies the fmha business and industrial 
development loan guarantee program which has languished in recent 
years will be aggressively reorganized and expanded

the key to winning the war against poverty is giving all 
americans the firstrate education that will guarantee them a job 
job training and retraining programs like formal education 
are also vital to preventing poverty 
i believe there is a great deal we can do to revitalize the 
rural economy so that fewer families are forced to live in poverty 
first we must improve and maintain our ability to compete for jobs 
and markets we need to improve rural infrastructures to attract 
new jobs we must make it easier for new enterprises to get started 
and for small businesses to stay in business we need strong 
presidential leadership to open markets abroad and help workers and 
farm families earn a decent income at home above all we need an 
agricultural policy that works

polygamy was banned in this west 
african country more than 20 years ago but it persists for much of 
the population because it makes life easier at least for the men 
one woman is not enough for an african man said soumahoro 
mekinhui a 64yearold retired civil servant who has four wives 
but is not sure how many children he has every woman has her 
role they clean house wash clothes prepare food and care for 
the children 
while the government doesnt try to enforce its ban on polygamy 
debate erupts every year over the practice and it always ends up 
inconclusive 
but theres no debate in mekinhuis home he is a moslem and his 
religion permits him to have four wives the only question is the 
number of children 
i dont know how many there are exactly perhaps 24 he said 
one recent evening relaxing in a stuffed vinyl chair at home 
they are too numerous 
large families are traditional in many parts of africa because 
children preferably males can help support the family and 
perpetuate the husbands name 
as mekinhui spoke to a reporter a 2yearold boy wandered into 
the room in his underwear and climbed onto his fathers lap his 
wife bakayoko 38 the fourth and youngest of the four sat in a 
chair across from him breastfeeding a yearold son chialo in 
one arm and holding a sleeping 2yearold in the other 
she was the only one of the wives at home the others were 
visiting their families and bakayoko was left to do the work of 
all of them 
her day began at 430 am which she said is her usual waking 
hour even when the other wives are home to help with the work 
she had prepared the familys food and washed the clothing she 
spent part of the day selling fruit at the market but at noon and 
in the evening she was home to prepare meals and look after her 
children 
this is a womans life she said theres never a dispute 
between me and the other wives i do what work i have to do its 
not too much for me 
my women are good mekinhui said there are those in other 
households who are impatient and always fight but not in my 
house 
marie antoinette aoulou producer on an ivorian television show 
on women said that because women outnumber men by a large margin 
in the country many women could not marry unless they agree to a 
polygamous marriage 
as such marriages remain outside the law the wives only 
recourse in marital disputes is to leave said yves roux chief 
lawyer at the ministry of justice 
we africans like to live in community roux added 
children are a gift of god a source of wealth they play an 
important economic role for the family 
he said the government banned polygamy mainly because costs of 
living rose as the country developed 
the government wanted families to adapt to the new economic 
situation to restrain spending 
polygamy also runs counter to efforts at population control and 
has the potential to cause friction between religious groups 
in nearby nigeria black africas most populous nation roman 
catholics criticized a recent populationcontrol policy limiting 
women to four children each church leaders said this would permit 
the polygamous moslem population to expand at the expense of 
monogamous christians 
about onethird of ivory coasts 10 million people are 
christians the rest are moslems or animists both of whom practice 
polygamy 
roux estimates that more than half the nation practices 
polygamy but exact numbers of polygamists are not known roux 
added that some men call their additional wives mistresses 
clouding even more any attempt to determine the fullest extent that 
polygamy is practiced 
he said the ivory coast government has been concerned about 
disturbances caused by disputes in polygamous families 
in interviews here children of polygamous marriages complained 
of families divided by jealous wives and of nasty disputes among 
children 
there are always personality problems between the women and 
often the disputes are uncontrollable said ramatou traure an 
unmarried seamstress in abidjan whose father had three wives 
the worst is when the women use black magic against each other 
nonetheless some ivorians believe the ban on polygamy should be 
lifted or at least modified to give people a choice 
once a year at least the polygamy ban comes up for debate with 
people discussing it in the streets in offices on the radio and 
the television and in the newspapers 
polygamy is still common in the cities and villages wrote 
narcisse haquat a professor at the national university in the 
official newspaper fraternite matin to legalize polygamy would 
be to take into account the sociological reality 
reality includes the rising costs of maintaining multiple wives 
it ruins the household ecomony said ibrahim diallo a 
moslem cafe owner in abidjan the man is always paying for food 
and supplies for his women and children 
mekinhui who said he lives on a monthly pension the equivalent 
of 175 acknowledged that it is difficult to make ends meet but 
he added that the burden is an honor a mans responsibility 
besides he observed his older sons help support him

no sandbag bunkers bar the way and sikh 
radicals arent waving rifles and submachine guns menacingly but 
inside the golden temple bearded young men look as determined as 
nearly four years ago when indian troops stormed sikhisms holiest 
shrine to dislodge militants 
today sikh radicals are again in control of the 17thcentury 
sanctuary the seat of sikh temporal power which has served as the 
base for their sixyear campaign for a separate nation in the 
indian state of punjab 
police in amritsar estimate that 100 to 200 sikh radicals most 
of them armed are inside the shrine at any given time slipping in 
and out almost at will 
they are a determined lot ruthless killers we are up against 
very nasty people said mohammad izhar alam the amritsar 
district police chief 
again the radicals are vowing to resist intrusion but now they 
say they will carry the battle well beyond the walled temple 
complex 
we have arms and very very committed men said nirvar 
singh one of the top sikh militant leaders in punjab this time 
if we are attacked the army will have to fight us all over 
northern india 
it will be real bloodbath in true sikh tradition 
as he spoke during an interview with the associated press in a 
windowless room of the temple about 20 young sikhs looked on 
warriors of the faith singh called them 
each of these men can die for the faith and we have thousands 
of them all over northern india 
the evidence is that despite 35000 police and 50000 
paramilitary troops in punjab the militants operate freely in the 
northern state bordering pakistan 
they have been blamed for about 300 deaths in the state since 
january in the same period last year 135 slayings were reported 
at least 17 visitors to the golden temple including a woman 
have disappeared this year all are believed to have been killed by 
the militants on suspicion of being police spies 
a classified police document shown to the associated press says 
the militants in punjab have at least 200 ak47 assault rifles 
1000 thompson submachine guns 1200 sten guns 50 selfloading 
rifles 10 light machine guns 250 enfield rifles 800 revolvers 
and a large number of hand grenades 
in almost every sikh home too is a 3foot sword kept shining 
and sharp under a religious obligation of the martial faith founded 
about 500 years ago as an alternative to the eras warring hindus 
and moslems 
alam the police chief said authorities could clear the shrine 
of militants if necessary but he questioned the costs 
we can storm the shrine but it has to be a political decision 
because the consequences will be farreaching he told a reporter 
sikhs who make up 2 percent of indias 780 million people have 
traditionally been the swordarm of the indian army many consider 
it a sacrilege for security forces to enter their shrines 
the 1984 assault on the golden temple left 1200 people dead 
most of them sikhs it so angered two sikh bodyguards of prime 
minister indira gandhi that they assassinated her five months later 
in new delhi 
ss virk the senior paramilitary officer in amritsar also 
expressed fear that driving sikh radicals from the temple could 
backfire and build support for them 
clearing the golden temple of the terrorists is not a very 
difficult task but after that what said virk who is the deputy 
director general of the central reserve police force 
forty miles to the north in the village of haruwal a young 
sikh ventured an answer if police enter the golden temple we 
will declare a war 
he refused to give his name but declared seven of us from 
this village have been to pakistan and we have enough arms to 
strike at will 
the village is a half mile from pakistan which denies indias 
repeated charges that it is supporting the sikh rebels 
to the south at fattu bheela village where the radicals 
recently killed three members of one family sikh farmer gurven 
singh said he knew the militants were killing innocent people 
but i cannot support police entering our shrines to get them 
in amritsar a spokesman for the panthic committee an umbrella 
group of radicals vowed to kill any enemy entering the golden 
temple 
we have a hit list if and when anyone from that list comes 
here we kill them said giani jagir singh we will kill them 
with our bare hands so much is our anger

oh yes nbc wants you to spend a half hour in a 
roomful of tots not once but three times this week as part of the 
unusual premiere schedule for day by day a new comedy from the 
creator of family ties 
preview episodes air tonight and thursday the series premieres 
in its regular time period on sunday in place of my two dads 
which will move around the schedule during the day by day 
spring tryout 
thanks to witty writing and a pleasant disposition day by 
day proves a lot easier to take than the 30 minutes of darling 
dialogue and squeaky tricycles the premise would seem to suggest 
linda kelsey and doug sheehan star as kate and brian harper a 
successful couple who have dropped out of the rat race to spend 
more time with their infant daughter by running a daycare center 
for toddlers in their home 
the series premise is based on family ties creator gary 
david goldbergs similar reallife experience 
day by day has the same gentle humor as family ties and 
is in many ways also reminiscent of growing pains theres even 
a kind of michael j foxkirk cameron standin cb barnes as 
15yearold ross the harpers older son 
in the first episode ross who apparently heretofore had little 
use for little ones gets uncharacteristically interested in the 
kiddieminding business to impress kristin the harpers beautiful 
assistant 
kristin theres something so attractive about a man holding a 
small child 
ross suddenly bolting after a romping child cmere 
theres ample opportunity for cheap sentimentality when ross 
promises little justin that the boys father will be at his 
birthday party not knowing justins parents are divorced 
but as in family ties the writing only flirts with 
corniness ross launches into a speech about resenting his own 
fathers absence when he was a child brian counters that hes 
given everything up now to be with his children but im 15 
now ross says i resent you being around 
added to the mix of nottoocute tykes is brians selfinvolved 
former coworker eileen still enthusiastically working her way up 
the corporate ladder she drops by to say she saw some children 
playing and was moved by the sight 
eileen i said eileen youve got a biological clock but 
your fingers on the snooze alarm shouldnt there be some little 
eileens 
kate eileen i never knew you felt that way 
eileen i do and coming over here always seems to cure me of 
it

little resemble the lineups they started with last fall

police commissioner kevin tucker drops 
management buzzwords like efficiency and costeffectiveness but 
what hes really talking about is battling a legacy of corruption 
in philadelphias police force 
a 47yearold former secret service officer who once protected 
jackie kennedy tucker is revamping a department that less than a 
year ago was labeled unfocused unmanaged undertrained 
underequipped and unaccountable 
as head of the nations fourth largest force tucker is credited 
with restoring morale and public confidence in a department 
crippled by a federal corruption probe and a deadly confrontation 
with the radical group move 
a 1986 survey revealed that 65 percent of philadelphians thought 
police officers used excessive force 49 percent thought they took 
bribes and 46 percent believed they slept on the job 
i dont represent corrupt or brutal police officers tucker 
said in an interview its my responsibility to find them and to 
deal with them as effectively as possible and to get rid of them 
since 1983 a federal investigation of police corruption has 
resulted in the conviction of 34 police officers including a 
deputy commissioner for extorting money from vice figures 
the department came under searing criticism for its handling of 
the may 1985 confrontation with the radical group move in which 11 
people died and 61 rowhouses were destroyed in a fire ignited by a 
police bomb 
in january 1986 tucker replaced gregore sambor who quit after 
the move debacle one of tuckers first actions was to appoint a 
civilian task force to examine the department top to bottom 
the group issued a 195page report last may attacking the 
forces management training infrastructure and relationship with 
the citys 16 million residents 
to us the philadelphia police departments development as an 
effective modern department seems arrested the 13member panel 
wrote the dead hand of past traditions guides the department 
rather than the challenge of the future 
so far over half the task forces 112 recommendations have been 
implemented and tucker gets credit 
he has communicated a clear positive modern image of what a 
metropolitan police department ought to be said william b 
eagleson jr chairman of the civilian police commissioners 
council hes a very strong leader 
among the few major gripes black officers charge tucker with 
failing to recruit and promote enough minorities who comprise just 
18 percent of the force in a city that is 42 percent black and 
hispanic 
philadelphia has the lowest crime rate among the nations top 10 
cities and is tied with detroit for the highest number of officers 
per capita 
still in 1974 the pennsylvania crime commission said of the 
philadelphia police corruption and political influence have 
plagued the force since its inception 
the forces reputation for violence grew under frank rizzo who 
was commissioner from 1967 to 71 and mayor from 1972 to 80 one 
study found that from 1975 to 78 41 percent of people shot by 
police were unarmed 
the last decade has included unconstitutional police sweeps 
dozens of false arrest charges and accusations of abuses by the 
police k9 unit according to city records more than 300 citizens 
were attacked by police dogs in the early 1980s 
tucker quickly reorganized the departments ethics and 
accountability division which helped arrest nine officers on 
corruption charges in 1986 and for the first time ever the 
department now has a statement of ethical principles 
theres no question that he was very serious about making 
changes in the way the police department handled matters involving 
the integrity of officers said us attorney edward sg dennis 
jr 
tucker was a police officer for two years in rahway nj 
before joining the secret service in 1965 he spent four years 
traveling around the world providing security for john f kennedys 
widow jacqueline kennedy and the couples two children 
from 1969 to 78 tucker was an agent in newark nj 
philadelphia and washington before taking over the philadelphia 
office he retired from the secret service in may 1985 
after six months in the private sector he accepted the 
commissioners job at a salary of 55000 a year a 20000 pay 
cut in january tucker received a pay raise to 85000 
the first outsider named police commissioner since 1924 tucker 
was greeted coolly by some members of the force including the 
influential head of the police union but reform has wooed the 
critics 
i think there isnt any doubt that this police force is 
responding to what is happening at the top said michael 
churchill chief counsel for the public interest law center many 
people in the force were disgusted by the crooks and the more 
brutal members and are pleased its not being condoned 
tucker sees policing as a partnership between officers and the 
public so hes opened a minipolice station in one of the citys 
worst drug neighborhoods and added victim assistance and crime 
prevention officers 
foot patrols have been increased officers are learning spanish 
computers are on order and nautilus exercising machines have been 
installed in police divisions 
i was convinced from my time here as head of the secret 
service that there were a lot of dedicated and competent people 
said tucker a burly 6footer with a brooklyn accent it was a 
question of giving them the opportunity to be innovative and 
creative 
tuckers tenure as head of the 6700member force hasnt been 
entirely smooth 
a federal lawsuit by the fraternal order of police has stymied 
his attempt to require polygraph tests for officers seeking to join 
an elite investigation team 
last year the commissioner was criticized for allowing officers 
to infiltrate political groups police believed would disrupt 
events celebrating the bicentennial of the constitution 
the guardian civic league which represents black officers has 
called for timetables for increasing the number of black 
supervisors 
i still see more effort in the hardware rather than in dealing 
with some core problems said detective ron oliver the leagues 
president 
tucker said he still has much to accomplish from modernizing 
facilities to upgrading officer performance standards 
im satisfied weve come a long way he said but a lot 
remains to be done and a lot of them are bigticket items

the stock market crash might have dropped the 
priceearnings ratios of some betterknown stocks but it didnt 
knock the dividends out of them 
true the boards of some companies might have rethought earlier 
notions of raising the payout but many others went right ahead and 
raised theirs 
for the first nine months of last year there was a 19 percent 
increase over the similar period of 1986 in the net number of 
increased corporate dividends in two of the following four months 
the trend was lower 
nevertheless a compilation by wright investors service shows 
dividends for the 500 companies in the standard amp poors index were 
73 percent higher in the final three months of 1987 matched 
against the similar 1986 period 
in fact the percentage of dividend increases in the fourth 
quarter of the year was higher than in the first three months 
wrights figures show that so far this year companies continue 
to express a good deal of faith in the future because that is what 
it takes to commit a major company to a higher dividend level 
of almost 600 companies all listed on the new york stock 
exchange that have declared dividends so far this year 360 or 
60 percent have raised their figures over the same period of 1987 
while some observers are inclined to declare these increases as 
additional evidence that octobers big collapse had only small 
repercussions on the economy there is probably a better 
explanation 
among other things the oct 19 debacle produced a very strange 
twist in the economic trend it reduced the prospects for a sharp 
increase in inflation and the subsequent threat of a serious 
recession 
recession still appears in the forecasts of most corporate 
economists but it is pushed deeper into the future if the 
executive suite listens to its economists it believes any 
recession is not likely before late this year 
adding to the sense of confidence about raising dividends is the 
historical record which shows that dividend yields are still low 
wright observes that the average dividend yield of the 500 
companies in the standard amp poors index is only 36 percent 
clearly out of line with history 
only during the period 1958 to 1972 wrights researchers found 
have such low yields prevailed even uncle sam is paying more 
there is close to a 5 percentagepoint yield advantage in treasury 
bonds compared with the sampp 500 average 
wright cautions that further increases are not in the bag by 
any means and even suggests there has been some additional loss of 
business confidence in the first two months of 1988 
but judging by forecasts of corporate economists that lower 
confidence is not a consequence of recession fears what appears to 
be a consensus forecast calls for relatively weak growth but 
growth nevertheless 
that is they may be laying back because of a sense of caution 
more than a loss of confidence and if that cautiousness lessens 
it conceivably could lift the lid on more dividend increases

for the first time in their history the 
japanese will be able to travel across the nations four main 
islands without taking a boat or a plane 
scheduled for opening soon is a transportation project that has 
been likened to the opening of the transcontinental railroad in the 
united states on may 10 1869 
the japanese project includes the worlds longest underwater 
tunnel and a mammoth bridge system 
but it has its critics and doubters who contend the project is 
unnecessary and is going to cost more than japan will be able to 
afford in the years ahead 
in march the 334mile seikan undersea tunnel will replace an 
80yearold ferry service when it goes into operation as a railroad 
line running under the tsugaru strait between aomori on the main 
island of honshu and hakodate in southern hokkaido 
in april the seto ohashi or great bridge comprised of six 
suspension bridges reaching five small islands in the seto inland 
sea will open to both rail and vehicle traffic between honshus 
okayama region and shikoku island in southern japan 
for the first time japanese will be able use ground transport 
to go from the northern island of hokkaido to the main island of 
honshu and on to kyushu or shikoku 
the two projects represent the largest engineering schemes ever 
attempted by japan and each is a major technological feat in itself 
yet critics question the investment of more than 17 billion in 
public money on what they contend is an outdated mode of 
transportation the railroad at a time when japans rapid rate 
of growth is slowing 
kyohei kakumoto a director of the japan transport economics 
research center and commentator on transportation issues said the 
projects were given the goahead by politicians in the 1960s at 
times of rapid economic growth and when forecasters predicted major 
increases in rail use 
the key point here is that even though planners were aware 
they erred in their original forecasts construction was still 
allowed to proceed kakumoto said and now that these projects 
are complete the people are finding themselves concerned about the 
lack of advantages 
the expressway portion of the bridge system is expected to 
recover costs which ran up to 87 billion over the 10year 
construction period if tourism reaches projected levels but 
transportation officials acknowledge that the rail lines will 
operate in the red in the tradition of the formerly stateoperated 
japan national railways jnr where the blueprints for the two 
major projects originated 
the seikan tunnel tailored for 23 million rail passengers and 
some 5 million tons of cargo each year carries a price tag of 85 
billion in overall construction outlays 162 million in annual 
maintenance costs and a yearly operating deficit of at least 231 
million 
a seikan tunnel official mitsuaki tanaka argued that the 
tunnel is justified because cargo and passengers will be 
transported safely regardless of weather conditions 
it now takes travelers four hours to cross the strait by ferry 
boat on waters that claimed the lives of more than 1100 passengers 
in a 1954 accident when rail service starts up march 13 the 
journey time will be cut by half 
kakumoto a former japan national railways official who has 
observed work on the both the tunnel and bridge since the start 
claimed the system will never be cost effective 
the longer that tunnel is used the larger the deficit will 
become he said if the ferries had been allowed to continue 
service we could have gotten by with keeping the deficit at its 
present level and still have met the needs of the locals 
but taizo omiya an engineer from aomori who spent 10 years 
working on the main seikan tunnel said the project should be 
backed as a national undertaking 
compared to the defense budget the cost of the tunnel is 
minimal if it brings prosperity to the region many people here 
feel it should backed by the government 
thirtyfour laborers lost their lives in the 16 years it took to 
build the tunnel 
shikoku island residents responding to recent survey were 
divided in their opinions on the seto bridge the first of three 
scheduled causeways to connect shikoku with honshu while 45 
percent were listed as saying the new bridge to would improve local 
lifestyles and spur development 44 percent replied they were 
unsure or that they expected the effects to be detrimental 
residents said they feared an influx of tourists would cause 
problems for their underdeveloped rail and road system 
in aomori businessmanhistorian masao mizuta echoed the local 
view that only politicians wanted japans famed shinkansen 
bullettrain line to extend up from morioka in neighboring iwate 
prefecture 
actually the people here are more concerned about how the 
disappearance of the ferries which have been the center of life in 
aomori will effect the region takada said even if the 
shinkansen comes through the only direct benefits will be some ski 
slopes and golf courses 
both the tunnel and the bridge were built to accommodate the 
bullet train and local officials insist that the new line will 
spur economic development in the backward regions of aomori 
hokkaido and shikoku

after years of kremlinimposed 
restrictions on artists soviet drama director genrietta yanovskaya 
finally knows she has the talent to please audiences abroad as well 
as at home 
the audiences here have been tremendous yanovskaya said 
after her moscow youth theater performed a longbanned work 
heart of a dog to sellout munich crowds 
the audience was still shouting bravo and clapping 
enthusiastically as yanovskayas cast made its seventh curtain call 
her troupe was one of six from the soviet capital that performed 
in the moscow in munich theater festival whose west german 
backers say reflects the sweeping soviet reforms under mikhail s 
gorbachev 
at last we soviet artists have an opportunity to do the 
things we want to do to do the things we dream about yanovskaya 
said in a backstage interview 
her longtime artistic collaborator scriptwriter alexander 
chervinsky agreed before gorbachev we artists were punished 
very badly by severe creative restrictions he said 
gorbachevs reforms have made it possible not only for soviet 
theaters to stage controversial works but for the six moscow 
theaters to bring their shows to munich 
the jan 14feb 6 festival showcased works that two years ago 
would have never made it past soviet officials because they focus 
on such topics as the repression of past kremlin regimes 
yanovskayas troupe of young thespians staged a play based on 
mikhail bulgakovs 1925 novel heart of a dog with a script by 
chervinsky 
at the start of the play shabbily dressed actors and actresses 
stand at the edge of the stage screaming in dramatized terror 
because of political repression in the 1920s and showing mock pain 
because of moscovites hunger at the time 
the satirical novel in which a dog is surgically transformed 
into a brutish lowlevel soviet official who turns on his creator 
was banned by soviet authorities until 1987 the novel has been 
widely read in the west 
that same year the 47yearold yanovskaya received permission 
to stage chervinskys version of bulgakovs novel muscovites 
packed her theater in the soviet capital to see the performances 
when we first got approval to do this play in moscow 
everybody had forgotten about our theater because nothing that was 
permitted was what people wanted to see said yanovskaya who has 
been in professional theater since the 1960s not even the taxi 
drivers knew their way to the theater now everyone in moscow 
knows 
but yanovskaya says that because people in her country were for 
years harshly restricted in what they could perform write or 
otherwise create the soviet reforms are putting artists to an 
unexpected test 
glasnost gave us more freedom in choosing what to do but that 
does not mean we always know how to make the right artistic 
decisions this is a real challenge she said in russian with 
chervinsky translating her remarks into english 
west german theater producer jochen hahn thought up the idea for 
the moscow in munich theater festival and flew to moscow to try 
to put it together 
the union of theater producers of the soviet union an 
unofficial organization founded in 1986 put up half the 14 
million cost for the munich festival hahn said the remainder came 
from west german federal and local government grants as well as 
private and corporate sources he said 
we were interested in how theater people are working with 
glasnost and perestroika hahn said referring to the russian 
words for respectively openness and restructuring 
we watched about 30 plays in moscow and were surprised 
about the openness displayed by theaters in dealing with 
controversial topics he said 
hahn says he had no problem getting official approval for his 
proposal despite the nightmare rumors i had heard about the 
soviet union it was just the right moment because of gorbachevs 
reforms for this happen 
however thats not to say that theaters have been given carte 
blanche in what they can stage and in how they do it theaters are 
still required to get permission from the authorities before going 
on with a show 
theater professionals in the soviet union also would like the 
opportunity to do more performances in the west 
i would love to play in new york some day i would like to see 
how i would be received by audiences in still other parts of the 
world said one young soviet actress who performed in munich 
speaking on condition that her name not be mentioned 
yanovskaya says bulgakovs ability to find comedy in the 
bleakest of circumstances is a trait she and her colleagues also 
relied on heavily in the preglasnost days 
you should not be too serious about yourself in this world to 
make it you have to understand comedy comedy is the only thing 
that helped us artists to survive she said

the career of german stage great 
bernhard minetti spans from the tumultuous days of the weimar 
republic to a current round of accolades for his contribution to 
the theater 
he recently was made an honorary member of frankfurts 
prestigous theater ensemble after receiving lengthy standing 
ovations for his final performance in samuel becketts classic 
krapps last tape at the city playhouse 
but the feisty 83yearold actor heatedly says hes not heading 
towards his last curtain call 
why should i quit im not sick said minetti who is known 
for his brusque manner and general dislike of talking to the news 
media 
over the years he has played some of the greatest roles theater 
has to offer always in his native german 
his shakespearean heroes have included hamlet othello and lear 
the actors roles by german playwrights have included both 
mephistopheles and faust in goethes faust robespierre in 
buechners dantons death and wallenstein in schillers 
wallenstein 
one of his favorite roles the craggyfaced actor said in an 
interview is king lear i would play lear again any time he 
said speaking in german 
another role he said he would play again is krapp in krapps 
last tape which he has been performing in frankfurt since last 
october to enthusiastic reviews 
projects for 1988 he said include starring in a play by german 
playwright gerhart hauptmann in berlin 
if you want any other information just read my book he 
said his voice rising 
minetti wrote the 1985 book memoirs of an actor with the 
help of frankfurt city theater director guenther ruehle 
minetti is certainly one of our countrys greatest actors 
ruehle said he has a strong personality and presence and brings 
a wonderful intellectual energy into his work 
minetti who now lives in west berlin was a member of the 
frankfurt city theater ensemble from 1951 to 1956 
critics praise minetti especially for leading roles he played as 
an older man 
the older he gets the better he is drama critic georg 
hensel of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper said 
minetti has impressed me most with his performances as king lear 
prospero and his work with the playwright thomas bernhard 
the actor is well known for his performances in works by 
austrian playwright bernhard who in 1976 wrote a play entitled 
minetti a portrait of the artist as an old man in the actors 
honor minetti starred in the poignant story of a lonely old actor 
and a little girl who visits him 
im constantly being asked whether im the minetti that thomas 
bernhard created minetti writes in his 1985 memoirs large 
portions of my life are not represented in bernhards plays on the 
other hand bernhard gets to the essence of my being as an actor 
frankfurts neue presse newspaper has called him west germanys 
grand old actor 
minettis professional career began in 1927 when the 
beleaguered weimar republic was trying to cope with mass 
unemployment and severe inflation but in 1933 adolf hitler took 
power destroying hopes of a democratic solution 
although minetti has worked in many west german cities he is 
best known as a berlin actor he was a member of berlins prussian 
state theater from 1930 to 1944 when world war ii forced the 
theater to close 
minetti recalls in his memoirs the day in 1934 when ensemble 
members gathered to hear gestapo head hermann goering appoint 
renowned actor gustav gruendgens director of the prussian state 
theater 
herr gruendgens you have been appointed to make this theater 
the best one in germany and with that the world minetti 
quoted goering as saying 
minetti devotes several sections of his memoirs to gruendgens 
whose experiences working for the nazis were the basis of klaus 
manns novel mephisto that novel formed the basis for the 
1981 academy awardwinning film starring klaus maria brandauer 
he gruendgens certainly suffered from many things that he 
couldnt change politically mentally and also ethically 
minetti wrote i often said to myself he has a cross to bear 
minetti was not a nazi sympathizer he said in a chapter called 
questions of conscience he writes of the problems artists had 
trying to get through the period 
minetti starred in more than a dozen films during the third 
reich but is not primarily thought of as a film actor 
today he occasionally participates in west germanys peace 
movement 
the arms buildup goes against the duty to be humane he 
said my desire to live and to act is still strong

the huge american flag has been replaced 
with tapestries of adam and eve in the garden of eden and bruce 
springsteen has shed his bandana and work boots for the less 
proletarian look of a boardwalk carny in his first return to the 
road since 1985 
but appearance is the least of the unexpected twists and turns 
provided by the rock star on his tunnel of love express tour 
the 22city show that opened feb 25 at the centrum in worcester 
its good to see you again i missed you springsteen told 
the opening night crowd of 12500 midway through a surprising first 
set that opened with the band as patrons at a boardwalk tunnel of 
love and springsteen as their host 
the opener bore little resemblance to the born in the usa 
world tour shows sharing only length more than three hours and 
intensity with the performances which made springsteen a megastar 
the 38yearold new jersey rocker aided by a fivepiece horn 
section and the usual assortment of e streeters rearranged and 
restructured virtually every song in the show from such 
springsteen classics as born to run to such new cuts as spare 
parts 
after opening with the title cut from his tunnel of love lp 
springsteen wearing black jeans a loosesleeved white dress 
shirt and white vest befuddled the crowd with an assortment of 
seldomheard songs 
virtually ignoring his albums nebraska the river and 
darkness on the edge of town the boss and his 12piece band 
played an assortment of bsides unreleased songs cover tunes and 
new material that eventually put the crowd in a frenzy 
be true a bside dating back to 1981 was the second song 
of the show another bside roulette was performed before the 
hit brilliant disguise 
eight songs from tunnel of love were featured in 
comparison only two from born to run surfaced during the show 
a pair of new songs were introduced the rhythm and bluesstyled 
im a coward when it comes to love and a reggaeflavored part 
man part monkey both were key elements in the second set which 
closed with springsteen and companys version of light of day 
the song he wrote that was performed by joan jett in the paul 
schraeder film of the same title 
a highlight of the second set was a rockabilly tune you can 
look but you better not touch with springsteen leading a 
congaline of bandmates across the stage while pianist roy bittan 
pounded out a jerry lee lewis riff 
the first encore featured an acoustic reworking of born to 
run with springsteen solo on guitar and harmonica followed by 
revamped versions of hungry hearts and glory days 
emphasizing the horn section of jersey bar band favorites labamba 
and the hubcaps 
after breaking new ground throughout the first 2 hours of the 
show springsteen returned to old territory for the knockout punch 
killer versions of rosalita and the mitch ryder detroit 
medley 
both these former show closers had been discarded during the 
last tour which ran from 19845 springsteen revived them and 
added covers of the 1960s classics sweet soul music and 
shake for good measure 
i forgot how much work this is a smiling springsteen told 
the crowd during the final encore looking out at 25000 raised 
hands he quickly added its fun too

crude oil prices have dipped below 16 for the 
first time since december reflecting worries about overproduction 
and higher inventories 
on the new york mercantile exchange thursday contracts for 
april delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us 
crude closed at 1592 per 42gallon barrel down 54 cents from 
wednesday 
it was the first time the nearmonth crude contract closed below

among march contracts for refined products wholesale heating 
oil closed at 4522 cents a gallon down 118 cents from wednesday 
while unleaded gasoline settled at 4537 cents per gallon 098 
cent lower 
analysts said technical factors and a report showing 
largerthanexpected us inventories helped to send prices lower 
thursday 
the catalyst of the decline was a federal energy information 
administration report issued wednesday night that showed us 
crude inventories up by 85 million barrels last week said william 
byers an analyst at bear stearns amp co 
that figure much greater than the 188 millionbarrel increase 
reported tuesday by the american petroleum institute a

three years ago today american tourists were 
flaunting dollars in paris and tokyo while bargainpriced west 
german cars rolled off arriving cargo ships 
feb 26 1985 marked the dollars highest point of the 1980s 
a level that economists say will probably never be seen again 
the strong dollar made americans rich in the eyes of the world 
but contributed to a huge trade deficit and damage to american 
industries unable to compete with a flood of inexpensive imports 
since then the dollar has lost roughly half its value against 
the currencies of japan west germany and some other trading 
partners 
against the japanese yen for example the dollar has fallen 
from a little more than 260 yen to a little less than 130 
the dollar has fallen less against the currencies of canada 
south korea and taiwan though and is actually stronger now 
against the currencies of mexico and brazil 
the cheaper dollar has brought about an export boom and the 
trade deficit has begun to shrink although more slowly than almost 
anyone had predicted 
meanwhile the dollar has flattened out in recent months 
pinched between speculators who expect it to rebound and others who 
say it has further to drop 
the dollars stability makes for boredom at the banks and 
securities firms that specialize in trading currencies where 
volatility is crucial to lock in profits 
this week has been about the deadest its been james 
hohorst managing director for foreign exchange at manufacturers 
hanover trust co said thursday 
currency traders are confident that the action will pick up 
though because governments cant agree on the coordination of 
economic policies that would allow for stable exchange rates 
hohorst 33 recalls once worrying about whether to commit his 
life to trading currencies because of the danger that governments 
would agree on fixed exchange rates 
but then i realized fixed exchange rates would depend on 
responsible governments he said so i stopped worrying about 
it

bank of new york co has tightened the noose 
around irving bank corp winning government approval to proceed 
with its 108 billion hostile bid and moving to oust the rivals 
directors if they dont capitulate 
the federal reserve board and new york state banking board 
concluded thursday that a shotgun marriage of the two large new 
york banks wouldnt hurt competition in the nations biggest 
financial center 
the approvals were significant because they could signal more 
hostile takeover attempts of banks which have been rare 
irving officials could not be reached thursday night but 
earlier they vowed to fight the takeover regardless of the 
governments decision though irvings defenses have shrunk the 
battle is expected to intensify 
after a meeting that lasted well into thursday night the feds 
governors unanimously sanctioned the bank of new yorks takeover 
attempt in a 58page order 
while noting the difference between friendly and hostile 
takeovers the central bank said federal law does not draw any 
distinction between acquisitions that are agreed to between the 
parties and those where as here there is no agreement 
as a condition however the fed requested the bank of new york 
to finance the 264 million cash portion of the proposed takeover 
by selling additional stock partly because of concerns that such a 
depletion of capital would weaken it financially 
bank of new york executives who have been maneuvering to 
acquire irving for months expressed delight with the feds 
approval and said they were confident the condition could be met 
we intend to proceed with our offer as expeditiously as 
possible said owen brady a bank of new york spokesman we 
again invite the board of directors of irving to reconsider their 
position sit down and talk to us and discuss ways in which the 
transaction can be concluded on a negotiated basis 
the bank of new york also said that as an irving shareholder 
with an approximate 483 percent stake it would nominate 16 people 
for election to irvings board at the annual shareholders meeting 
april 21 the move was seen as another strategy to pressure irving 
into agreeing to a takeover 
earlier thursday the bank of new york won approval from the 
state banking board which regulates many of the nations biggest 
banks 
jill m considine board superintendent said a combination of 
the two banks met all state requirements wouldnt hurt competition 
and would benefit the public with a wider range of services 
such a merger would create the nations 12th largest bank 
holding company with assets totaling around 417 billion 
despite bank of new yorks successes thursday analysts said it 
still faced a battle for control of irving 
theres no reason to think they could strike a deal with bank 
of new york chances are slim said rosemarie conforte a banking 
analyst with moodys investors service their goal is to remain 
independent or maybe combine with somebody else they feel makes 
more sense although i dont know who that is 
shareholders of both banks would have to approve the merger and 
bank of new york shareholders might react unhappily at the prospect 
of an additional stock issue that could dilute the value of their 
holdings 
in composite new york stock exchange trading thursday irving 
stock jumped 3 a share to 5350 bank of new york fell 12 cents 
to 2950 
in an effort to bolster its takeover defenses and place stock in 
friendly hands irving announced tuesday that 15 investors were 
issued 1001 million worth of cumulative convertible preferred 
stock which have expanded voting rights and other entitlements 
that could foil a hostile bid 
earlier this month irvings board rejected as inadequate bank 
of new yorks revised offer to pay 15 in cash and 1575 shares of 
its own stock for each of irvings roughly 181 million common 
shares outstanding that amounts to about 60 per share or 108 
billion 
bank of new york initially offered to pay 80 in cash and 
securities for irving last september it reduced the offer twice 
after the october stock market crash

gasoline retailer getty petroleum corp cousin 
of a texaco inc takeover four years ago that later would bring 
texaco to its knees has now joined the contest for buying chunks 
of the troubled oil giant 
getty announced thursday that it has bought 14 million worth of 
texaco shares and is seeking government permission to acquire more 
the jericho nybased company born of texacos 1984 takeover 
of getty oil co said it would ask the federal trade commission to 
let it buy more than 15 million of texacos stock in accordance 
with government regulations 
getty is the third party holding or in the process of lining 
up a large block of texaco stock but analysts said getty was not 
large enough to harbor any notions of swallowing texaco 
rosario ilacqua an industry analyst at nikko securities co 
international inc said 15 million is peanuts when it takes 
42 million to buy roughtly 1 million of texacos 243 million 
shares 
he suggested getty might be hoping to make money on its stock 
or perhaps negotiate its holding into some texaco assets in the 
future either with the company or some other party or parties 
george friesen who watches oil companies for the dean witter 
reynolds inc securities firm also held that view 
i suspect well have a number of smaller predators circling 
the prey and relying on the bigger predators to do the job for 
them he said i cant imagine getty becoming a big player 
last friday t boone pickens a takeover strategist who 
controls mesa limited partnership an oil and gas concern also 
expressed interest in buying texaco shares he joined fellow raider 
carl c icahn texacos biggest shareholder 
getty spokesman stephen salzman said that his company had not 
been in contact with either icahn or pickens and was unwilling to 
say if it would join icahns effort to gain a greater voice in 
running texaco 
in late trading on the new york stock exchange thursday texaco 
stock stood at at 4287 per share up 62 cents 
we believe that texaco is an excellent company which is 
substantially undervalued leo leibowitz gettys president said 
in a statement we are purchasing shares of texaco for investment 
purchases at this time 
getty is one of the nations largest independent marketers of 
gasoline and refined products doing business in 11 states in the 
northeast and midatlantic regions getty was known as power test 
corp until january 1985 when it acquired getty oils retail 
operation and the getty name 
gettys interest in texaco coincides with texacos effort to 
exit the refuge of federal bankruptcy court sought nearly a year 
ago because of a 1053 billion judgment held against it by 
pennzoil co 
the judgment stemmed from a houston jurys ruling that texaco 
had illegally interfered with move by pennzoil to acquire getty oil 
and bought getty itself 
in december texaco agreed to pay pennzoil 3 billion in cash to 
settle the dispute as part of an overall plan to reorganize and 
emerge from bankruptcy 
shareholders are voting whether to approve that plan with the 
results due to be announced at a march 22 hearing in us 
bankruptcy court in white plains ny texacos corporate home

the judge who heard the 
pennzoiltexaco case is listed in an attorneys directory as having 
a law degree but the judge only has an undergraduate degree 
solomon casseb jr 72 a prominent san antonio attorney 
garnered national renown after presiding over the controversial 
1053 billion judgment that a houston jury ordered texaco to pay 
pennzoil in 1985 the biggest civil damage award in history 
casseb does not have a law degree although the authoritative 
102yearold martindalehubbell law directory lists casseb as 
having a law degree from the university of texas 
it is legal to practice law or sit on the bench in texas without 
having a law degree because during an earlier era it was possible 
to pass the texas bar exam and become a licensed atorney without 
having graduated law school 
larry fitzgerald a spokesman for the state bar of texas said 
that casseb was a member in good standing 
we have absolutely no reason at all to say anything is wrong 
at this point fitzgerald said as far as state bar of texas is 
concerned the man is a licensed attorney passed the law exam and 
never had a grievance against him 
richard pizzi a spokesman for martindalehubbell said thursday 
that the company has two casseb application forms on microfiche 
one from 1938 and the other from 1974 the original application 
forms for inclusion in the directory were destroyed years ago 
pizzi said 
pizzi said the 1974 application form is illegible but the 1938 
form listed casseb as receiving a bachelor of arts degree from st 
marys in 1936 and a bachelor of law degree from ut in 1938 
the application has cassebs name typed in the signature line 
but it is not signed pizzi said 
we dont require a signature and we dont require a 
certification we rely on the representation of the attorney 
pizzi said about the law degree i dont know if he said it but 
whoever filled in the form said it 
records show that casseb attended st marys university in san 
antonio as an undergraduate prelaw student from 1932 to 1935 said 
registrar spokeswoman helen garza 
casseb then went to the university of texas at austin law school 
for three years but did not receive a degree dean susana aleman 
said 
instead casseb applied his law school credit to his bachelor of 
arts degree which he received from st marys in 1938 
casseb was hearing a civil case in laredo on thursday and did 
not return telephone calls to the associated press attorneys for 
texaco and pennzoil also did not return calls

the united auto workers union is 
stepping up pressure aimed at discouraging chrysler corp from 
selling its 1 billion acustar inc partsmaking arm 
more than 1000 angry workers gathered outside chrysler 
headquarters in belowfreezing temperatures thursday chanting 
strike strike to protest the proposed sale of the 
28000worker subsidiary which represents nearly a fifth of 
chryslers worldwide operations 
you do whatever you need to do and you know what to do 
uaw vice president marc stepp told the demonstrators which 
followed a special meeting of the 140delegate chrysler bargaining 
council representing the companys 49 uaw locals 
although the union cant legally call a national strike against 
chrysler over acustar stepp said he will give local uaw unions 
permission to strike on a plantbyplant basis over unresolved 
issues such as healthandsafety grievances 
a series of local strikes at key chrysler plants could shut down 
the company nationwide just as easily 
at least seven chrysler locals have voted to seek strike 
authorization and one a key 4000worker stamping plant in 
sterling heights should receive authorization as early as next 
week stepp predicted 
acustar which has plants in mexico and canada as well as the 
united states represents nearly a fifth of chryslers worldwide 
operations already the leanest among the big three us automakers 
chrysler has said it may sell acustar because it doesnt want to 
invest in the research needed to upgrade some operations chrysler 
already buys 70 percent of its parts elsewhere 
the potential sale of acustar would generate funds for future 
investments but the primary reason we would sell acustar is 
because longterm we want to concentrate our resources on new 
product and powertrains rather than components the company said 
in a statement 
acustars best chance to progress may be to operate as an 
independent company free to pursue business opportunities beyond 
chrysler the statement said 
workers say they are angry at the possible sale because they 
made concessions and helped chairman lee iacocca win loan 
guarantees from the federal government to rescue the company from 
the verge of bankruptcy at the beginning of the decade

the visit followed signing of a swissus agreement designed to 
speed up cooperation in such cases last november the committee 
oversees the us securities and exchange commission 
several days into the visit a geneva bank alerted swiss 
authorities that the us investigators allegedly overstepped their 
mandate demanding details on a possible swiss link to a major 
insider trading case involving wall street dealer dennis levine 
lautenberg said 
he said authorities warned the congress staffers about swiss 
laws on economic espionage and banking secrecy and told them a 
swiss official would accompany them for their remaining interviews 
thereupon the us investigators left abruptly 
switzerlands ambassador in washington klaus jacobi meanwhile 
has tried to smooth the affair in talks with rep john dingell a 
michigan democrat who heads the committee 
bern and washington had lengthy diplomatic rows over exchange of 
information in the dennis levine case and another us probe in the 
early 1980s involving marc rich a commodities trader now based in 
switzerland

the european economic community edged up on average 02 percent in 
january from december and 3 percent from the yearearlier month 
the eec statistical office eurostat reported friday 
the eecs yeartoyear inflation rate of 3 percent in january 
compares with 32 percent in december 
eurostat said the steepest price increases were recorded in 
italy 05 percent denmark 05 percent spain 06 percent and 
portugal 1 percent 
west germany france and luxembourg reported moderate increases 
of 02 percent or less while prices in britain remained unchanged 
according to eurostat january prices declined in three 
countries including the netherlands 08 percent belgium 01

consumer prices rose 03 percent in january as 
the year began with a moderate dose of inflation the government 
reported today higher grocery prices partially offset declines in 
energy costs 
the increase in the labor departments consumer price index was 
equivalant to an annual rate of inflation of 42 percent compared 
to the 44 percent rise for all of 1987 
last months increase was larger than the 02 percent rise in 
december and matched novembers 03 percent rise decembers 
increase was revised from the previously reported 01 percent 
pacing the january increase were widespread gains across a range 
of goods and services energy prices however supplied a major 
dampening on the overall rate by plunging 07 percent after a 08 
percent drop in the preceding month 
gasoline prices fell 16 percent heating oil costs were down 
08 percent the price of natural gas and electricity combined 
fell 03 percent 
food prices rose 03 percent down from decembers 06 percent 
gain pacing last months rise were jumps in prices for poultry 
eggs and bakery products meat fruit and vegetable prices declined 
subtracting the usually volative food and energy categories 
consumer prices for all other goods and services rose a sharp 05 
percent in january after a 02 percent increase in december 
januarys report underscored forecasts by many analysts that any 
significant change in the inflation rate was unlikely this year 
the underlying rate of inflation looks to be 3 percent to 4 
percent said allen sinai chief economist for the boston company 
economic advisers the question mark is on the energy price 
side 
the reagan administration has predicted an inflation rate of 43 
percent this year 
energy prices which tumbled in 1986 partially rebounded 
through 1987 but more recently oil prices again have been falling 
recently dipping below 17abarrel on the spot market from the 
18abarrel prices that prevailed in december and from prices of 
around 19 a barrel in november 
while petroleum prices have fallen recently anlaysts also said 
they expected to see a rise in natural gas costs 
energy prices may continue to soften through late spring 
providing continuing offsets to food prices which are expected to 
remain on an upward path said donald ratajczak a georgia state 
university economist who specializes in prices 
supply shortages and weather and crop infestation problems 
particularly in california and arizona have pushed up food prices 
in recent months after climbing through the fall fruit and 
vegetable prices fell 04 percent last month 
beef prices were down 14 percent while pork priced declined 05 
percent poultry prices however climbed 10 percent their first 
increase since august cereal and bakery product prices rose 11 
percent 
overall grocery prices were up 02 percent while restaurant 
meal costs climbed 03 percent 
the labor department gave these other specifics of january price 
behavior 
new automobile prices were down 02 percent used automobile 
prices fell 01 percent 
housing expenses were up 04 percent 
apparel costs gained 01 percent 
medical care expenses rose 08 percent its largest increase in 
two years 
entertainment costs gained 09 percent 
januarys increase left the cpi at 1157 meaning that a 
selection of goods and services that cost 100 during a 198284 
base period cost would have 11570 last month 
the department recently abandoned a 1967 base period in favor of 
the 1982 standard under that base period a selection of goods and 
services costing 100 in that year would have cost 34670 last 
month 
using either base number the gain from january 1986 would have 
been 156 
the overall index is not adjusted for seasonal variations other 
figures in the report are 
the major source of inflation in the months ahead likely is to 
come from higher import prices resulting from declines in the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar 
the dollar is now worth only half of its 1985value against 
japanese and key european currencies these exchange rate changes 
have begun to show up in the form of higher import prices for a 
wide variety of goods at the same time us items are becoming 
less expensive abroad 
the weaker dollar is expected to help trim the nations huge 
trade deficit although higher priced foreign goods might be the 
price americans will have to pay for more trade balance 
still there is too much slack in the us economy and too 
much slack in the world economy to worry about steep inflation as 
a result of higher import prices said jay goldinger chief 
economist for capital insight a los angeles bond brokerage 
many economists say this slackness is illustrated by a recent 
slowdown in consumer spending a slowdown that will keep 
inflationary pressures at a minimum consumer spending dropped 31 
percent in the fourth quarter of 1987 the steepest plunge in more 
than seven years the commerce department reported on thursday 
while most private economists deem a major bout of new inflation 
unlikely federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan suggested 
earlier this week that chances of a resurging inflation and of a 
recession are now roughly equal 
the companion producer price index which only includes 
domestically produced items and does not cover imports or services 
showed a 04 percent rise in wholesale prices in january

a broadscale consumption tax of 
some sort may be the best medicine for the nations economic 
woes former federal reserve board head paul volcker says 
i dont think we are approaching doomsday he said speaking 
thursday before a seminar held by the national association of 
industrial and office parks i do not think we face inevitable 
recession or inevitable inflation or a combination of the two 
i think we are in control of our destiny but i dont think we 
can take the future for granted he said 
new york stock traders blamed volckers remarks for helping kill 
a morning stock rally thursday although he has publicly advocated 
tax increases before 
to alleviate the nations trade deficit foreign debts and 
declining dollar volcker said we need to start with the federal 
budget deficit 
i think theres some amount of wishful thinking about the 
budget deficit he said id like to think we can solve it all 
by a little spending restraint but i dont think thats possible 
certain elements of spending are going to increase and you 
know it he said 
a combination of spending cuts and tax increases are needed to 
cure the deficit he said 
the newly reformed income tax structure should be left alone and 
given a chance to work volcker said instead he recommended a 
consumption tax to raise revenue 
as an example volcker cited a very sizeable increase in the 
gasoline tax which by world standards is relatively low is it 
really so impossible to add 10 or 15 cents to the gasoline tax 
i do not think this problem is insoluble volcker said of 
the budget deficit i think its quite readily soluble 
at a press conference after his speech volcker said the 
political pressure of this years presidential campaign is 
discouraging a meaningful discussion on the nations large budget 
and trade deficits 
the tendency in democracies is to wait for a crisis volcker 
said in his speech it is terribly important that we put a sense 
of reality in this situation and get this issue before the 
american public in a way that the political campaign does not 
undermine 
both the federal government and american businesses must wean 
themselves away from their dependence on foreign capital volcker 
said 
people are not going to lend us money indefinitely to finance 
the deficit he said

the european economic community said 
friday it has authorized spain to cut the imports of japanese cars 
and trucks to 2000 units through much of this year 
the eec executive commission which granted the authorization 
said the move was needed to protect spains fledgling car industry 
from noncommunity imports coming largely from japan 
citing spanish figures the commission said car and truck 
imports to spain rose to nearly 400000 units in 1987 from 70190 
in 1985 an increase of over 435 percent of the 1987 total 11582 
cars and trucks were imported from noncommunity countries 
in spain the share of domestically produced cars fell to 648 
percent from 894 percent over the same threeyear perid the 
commission said 
separately willy de clercq the top eec trade official said 
the commission wants to conclude an agreement with japan to hold 
imports mainly cars to around 10 percent of the community market 
he said in a speech to french businessmen in lille thursday that 
japan sold 118 million cars in the eec last year this represents 
about 11 percent of the european car market 
de clercq said the arrangements would be transitional to 
give the communitys car industry time to restructure 
the commission has been under pressure from automakers to impose 
eecwide limits on japanese car sales following a surge in the 
imports in the first five months of 1987 
the eec car industry has also expressed fear that the 
communitys plan to abolish all internal borders and create one 
integrated market by 1992 will lead to a flood of japanese imports 
japanese car imports are currently subject to a variety of 
national rules ranging from no restrictions in west germany to 
strict numerical limitations in italy and spain 
any national curbs however must be approved by the eec 
commission 
in his speech de clercq urged japan to open its market to 
european car exports in order to boost europeans market share to 5 
percent from its current level of 27 percent 
he said eec car makers sold 87000 vehicles in japan last year 
a commission official who declined to be identified said there 
are no negotiations under way at present on limiting car imports 
there are continuing contacts however the official said

now that more and more people are investing on 
an international scale many wall streeters these days are teaching 
themselves to think in foreign currencies 
the exercise is relatively simple nothing like having to learn 
a whole new language and it seems a logical way to try to 
understand what has motivated foreign investors operating in this 
country in the recent past and what they might do in the future 
the dollar of course has taken a drastic drop since the 
mid1980s against important foreign currencies 
in early 1985 a dollar could be exchanged for more than 250 
japanese yen recently it was worth about 129 yen similarly the 
exchange rate has fallen from more than 3 west german marks per 
dollar to about 17 
to understand the kind of impact such wide swings can have on 
financial decisions and distort the way they are perceived burton 
siegel chief investment officer at drexel burnham lambert inc 
speaks of the dave righetti effect 
as followers of the sports pages know righetti is a standout 
pitcher for the new york yankees who was offered and decided not 
to accept a deal to play in japan under a twoyear contract that 
would pay him something on the order of 10 million 
even in these days of boxcarnumber sports salaries the figure 
was regarded as mindboggling 
but as siegel points out in currencyadjusted terms the 
offer was handsome but not quite as expensive to the japanese as 
it first appears indeed when adjusted for the yendollar 
relationship the proposal was in line with salaries being paid to 
top players in the united states 
the same analyses can be applied to recent auctions of fine 
art in which japanese and euopean collectorsinvestors bid up 
dollar prices 
what does all this mean for other businesses and the stock and 
bond markets 
if the dollar is going to keep dropping in foreign exchange it 
would be a negative for foreign investors reducing or eliminating 
the return they realize from investments denominated in dollars 
but if the dollar is perceived as fundamentally cheap the story 
could well be very different 
says siegel foreign corporations may be especially attracted 
to the opportunity to acquire existing usbased operating assets 
this avoids the delay of starting from scratch and can sometimes be 
done at lower cost 
this may be especially appealing to foreign companies 
interested in handling usproduced goods through their own 
international distribution systems 
foreign companies anxious to increase or maintain their market 
share in the us may also be attracted to the ability to produce 
in the now costcompetitive us 
thinking in yen or marks yields another interesting point when 
stated in those currencies standard amp poors 500stock composite 
index is now substantially below where it stood at the beginning of 
1985 
thus from a foreign investors viewpoint wall street has been 
experiencing a bear market for more than three years 
there is a danger in carrying this kind of analysis too far to 
illustrate that greg smith an analyst at prudentialbache 
securities recently suggested a remedy if a friend or relative 
remarks that you seem to have put on weight lately tell them 
that in yen you have actually lost five pounds

new sales of life insurance increased 
11 percent in 1987 to 11 billion representing an improvement over 
1986 but short of the other gains in the early 1980s an industry 
group said 
the life insurance marketing and research association based 
here said thursday that 98 billion in new life insurance 
policies were purchased in 1986 
by contrast new sales of life insurance grew 25 percent in 1983 
and 15 percent in 1985 according to the trade assication with 596 
member companies around the world 
1987 was a challenging year for sure but the industry as a 
whole maintained a strong steady growth pattern despite tremendous 
economic uncertainty said ronald a bishop the associations 
chairman and vice chairman of national life insurance co in 
montpelier vt 
the premium figures include only 10 percent of the money paid 
for singlepremium life insurance which is bought with a large 
lump sum often 20000 of more 
the association says that to include the total amounts paid for 
those products which are relatively new would skew the statistics

consumer prices rose 03 percent in january matching 03 
percent increases in americans personal incomes and consumer 
spending for the same month the government reported today 
the rise in the labor departments consumer price index was 
larger than the 02 percent rise in december and matched novembers 
03 percent rise the gain in december was revised from the 
previously reported 01 percent 
pacing the january increase in consumer prices were widespread 
gains across a range of goods and services including a 03 percent 
gain in food prices 
energy prices however fell 07 percent after a 08 percent 
drop in the preceding month the report said 
the overall increase in january prices was equivalent to an 
annual rate of inflation of 42 percent compared with the 44 
percent rise for all of 1987 
the january gains reported by the commerce department in 
personal income and consumer spending were less than half the gains 
posted in december 
the department said the 03 percent seasonally adjusted increase 
in incomes followed a 07 percent rise in december and was the 
slowest income gain since a 04 percent decline in november 
the 03 percent rise in spending represented a slowdown from a 
07 percent december advance spending had risen 05 percent in 
november after falling 07 percent in october reflecting a decline 
in auto purchases that month 
the reports came a day after the government reported that 
economic expansion at the end of 1987 reached the fastest level in 
almost two years 
the commerce departments announcement thursday that the economy 
grew at a 45 percent annual rate in the last three months of last 
year initially rallied wall street but stocks later fell sharply 
bond prices and the dollar also fell 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials up about 27 points at 
its midsession high closed with a 2238point loss at 201757 
most of it in the last hour of trading 
there is a considerable amount of confusion in the financial 
markets about the strength of the economy said jack barbanel 
senior vice president at gruntal amp co in new york 
the growth in the gross national product the broadest measure 
of the economy was revised up from an original estimate of 42 
percent made a month ago 
the reagan administration said the growth rate showed the 
economic recovery now in its sixth year a record for peacetime 
was suffering no ill effects from the october stock market 
collapse however private economists said they were still 
concerned about the onesided nature of the growth 
the rapid expansion in the fourth quarter occured without a 
pickup in inflation a price index tied to the gnp rose at an 
annual rate of 37 percent from october through december little 
changed from a 34 percent increase in the third quarter 
threefourths of the growth last quarter came from a buildup of 
business inventories occurring at the same time that consumer 
spending was plunging 31 percent the biggest spending drop in 
more than seven years 
the last such sharp drop in consumer spending occurred in 1980 
during the recession that year which helped doom president jimmy 
carters reelection bid 
some analysts said the revisions made in the new gnp report made 
them more confident that a recession can be avoided others said 
they were encouraged because the report showed that consumer 
spending while falling sharply was not as weak as previously 
believed the report also increased the estimate of business 
investment spending another area of expected strength 
the fourthquarter gain boosted growth for the year to 39 
percent when measured from the end of 1986 up slightly from the 
38 percent estimate made a month ago growth when all four 
quarters of the year are averaged together showed a 29 percent 
increase in 1987 the same as 1986

northwest airlines and its flight 
attendants are on a collision course and a strike by the 
attendants appears to be imminent according to a teamsters union 
official 
several dozen flight attendants demonstrated thursday night 
outside the eagan minn home of northwest chief executive officer 
steven rothmeier the home was watched by private guards and eagan 
police 
mr rothmeier has been traveling around the circuit all of 
this week visiting all of our flight attendant bases we thought 
it was only polite to return the favor flight attendant dottie 
malinski told wccotv 
it was not known if rothmeier was home at the time 
talks continued thursday as flight attendants prepared to walk 
off their jobs at 1101 cst tonight 
theres a 100 percent chance of a strike william genoese 
director of the teamsters airline division said at a morning news 
conference thursday as far as im concerned were on a collision 
course with northwest airlines to strike 
but redmond tyler a spokesman for the airline said progress 
was being made on some of the major contract issues the two sides 
have been meeting steadily since tuesday at northwests 
headquarters in eagan with the assistance of a federal mediator 
tyler said thursday 
seniority wage scales pensions and work rules are among the 
major issues in the dispute former republic airlines flight 
attendants have been working under their old contract since 
northwest acquired republic in 1986 the company is trying to bring 
the workers under one contract 
we believe were making substantial progress at the bargaining 
table tyler said were not jimmy the greek but we continue 
to believe that we will get this resolved without a strike 
flight attendants have voted overwhelmingly to strike if a 
contract agreement isnt reached by the 11 pm cst deadline the 
national president of the international association of machinists 
has vowed his unions support but the telegram that contains the 
message stops short of saying machinists would honor picket lines 
officials at national and local iam offices did not return a 
reporters phone calls thursday 
tyler said the machinists are under a contract that forbids them 
to strike in sympathy with another union we expect our 
machinists to honor their contract he said 
pilots are barred from sympathy strikes under provisions of the 
railway labor act tyler said 
asked if those workers would be locked out if they walk off 
their jobs in sympathy with the flight attendants tyler said we 
wont address that because we dont want to play that what if 
game 
genoese said flight attendants would have the full backing of 
the international teamsters which could result in delays of supply 
shipments from truckers 
were putting all our power together in the next 24 hours 
genoese said we would like to put them northwest at 10 to 20 
percent of operations if there is a strike 
genoese said he is hopeful that pilots would honor picket lines 
but jim halverson of the air line pilots association said pilots 
would not decide until today 
tyler said the airline is armed with about 2000 management 
workers who are certified as flight attendants to step in if the 
6700 union flight attendants strike 
the machinists union represents about 20000 airline mechanics 
baggage handlers aircraft cleaners ticket and reservation agents 
and clerical workers at northwest 
genoese said thursday the teamsters are researching the 
possibilities of an employeeled leveraged buyout of northwest and 
other airlines to protect the longterm interests of workers 
he said his union has talked with salomon brothers inc and 
other wall street investment firms to consider financing 
arrangements however robert salomon managing director and chief 
spokesman of the firm said he is unaware of any contact between 
the teamsters and his company on the issue 
genoese said discussions of a possible leveraged buyout of 
northwest could help the bargaining position of flight attendants 
but he said the talk was not a ploy

chrysler corp hopes to add passenger cars to the 
line of jeeps it already produces in china a top official of the 
automaker said friday 
gerald greenwald head of the chrysler motors division of 
chrysler corp said in an interview that his company was 
negotiating with first automotive works of changchun in northeast 
china to produce upscale autos for use as official cars and taxis 
first automotive hopes to begin construction by the end of the 
year on a plant that initially would produce 30000 cars a year 
with potential capacity of 150000 greenwald said 
if successful chrysler would be the first american automaker to 
set up passsenger car production in china and the third foreign 
company peugeot has a small joint venture in canton and 
volkswagen produces about 10000 vehicles a year at its shanghai 
plant 
china produced about 400000 motor vehicles last year almost 
all trucks and buses only about 20000 passenger cars were built 
chrysler inherited a stake in china last year when it took over 
american motors corp which produces cherokee jeeps as part of a 
joint venture known as beijing jeep co 
beijing jeep has had a rocky road since it began as a 
muchheralded sinoamerican joint venture in 1984 two years ago 
the plant shut down for two months because it ran out of foreign 
currency to import the parts it needed to stay in operation the 
chinese government finally agreed to provide financial support 
after exacting promises that the plant would use more domestically 
produced components 
greenwald said that currently about 18 percent of parts are made 
locally he said the process to increase the local percentage will 
take years but that eventually as production climbs from the 
current 4000 vehicles a year to 3000040000 vehicles 
localization of parts could top 50 percent 
we have an excellent start with the two projects with beijin 
jeep and first automotive greenwald said we want to move ahead 
at a faster pace 
greenwald said he did not know what other companies were bidding 
for the passengercar contract but chrysler is thought to have an 
edge because it signed a deal with first automotive last july to 
supply technology for fourcylinder engines to the company the 
chinese company is to produce 150000 engines under the initial 
stage of the agreement with chrysler 
at the end of last year the chinese government sent a 
highlevel delegation to the united states to seek a partner in a 
major auto production joint venture chrysler is believed to have 
an advantage because of its previous activities in china although 
general motors corp sold an engine assembly line to china last 
month in what it said was a first step toward eventual 
coproduction 
greenwald said the 22liter engine to be produced in changchun 
could be used in first automotives envisioned car giving the 
company a needed boost in its drive to cut back on foreign currency 
spending by relying on domestically produced parts

the bad news has been pouring in from all 
sides recently for eastman kodak co as rivals partners judges 
and financial analysts take turns bashing the company 
a questioned merger bam battery troubles pow the 
potential for a whopping damage award to polaroid corp sock a 
downgraded bond rating boom 
it seems like kodak cant do anything right said robert 
maney a local stock analyst with prudential bache securities inc 
every time they get one thing cleared up another thing comes 
along and hits them on the head like a hammer 
things had been looking up for the photographic and chemical 
giant which announced record sales and tripled profits for 1987 
after two years of cost cutting and restructuring 
but just two months into 1988 triumph has turned to trouble 
we dont see it that way countered kodak spokesman henry 
kaska its just coincidence that all these things have come 
together at the same time 
kodaks woes began jan 22 a friday with the companys 
surprise announcment of a 51 billion effort to acquire sterling 
drug inc maker of such products as bayer aspirin and lysol 
disinfectant and prescription drugs 
stock analysts criticized the deal as being too expensive and 
several stopped recommending kodaks stock 
four weeks later on feb 19 another friday kodak found out 
that polaroid corp wanted a federal judge to award 57 billion in 
damages for kodaks violation of instant photography patents 
several times earlier estimates 
kodak officials called polaroids estimate ridiculously 
inflated 
the same day kodak announced that it had determined its 
innovative 9volt lithium battery which was supposed to have a 
shelf life of 10 years doesnt last that long 
that revelation prompted black amp decker corp which sold two 
lines of miniflashlights with the lithium cells included to pull 
the products from the shelves immediately 
we cant very well continue to be associated with something 
like this said barbara lucas a spokeswoman for the 
baltimorebased company 
last monday a federal judge in fort worth texas put kodaks 
planned joint venture with fuqua industries inc on hold ruling 
that a tiny photofinishing competitor phototron corp of san 
bernardino calif had grounds for an antitrust lawsuit 
the venture with colorcraft corp a fuqua subsidiary would 
create the nations largest wholesale photofinishing operation with 
potential control of up to 80 percent of the market according to 
claims by phototron that are disputed by kodak 
moodys investors service lowered its rating of kodak and 
sterling senior debt three levels from aa2 to a2 the lowest 
rating kodak has ever had according to john dean a moodys 
analyst 
the services highest rating is aaa followed by aa1 and aa2 
standard amp poors corp disappointed kodak by lowering its 
ratings even further 
on thursday kodak officials held a special meeting with stock 
analysts in new york in an effort to stop the flow of bad news 
about the company and put an end to the storm cloud that seems to 
be hovering over its sterling deal 
kay whitmore kodaks president told analysts that they had 
lowered their profit expectations too much because of the sterling 
deal and that kodak earnings will meet or exceed profit estimates 
made at the start of the year which ranged from 4 to 440 a 
share 
several analysts had dropped their estimates down to 375 
before the kodak meeting in 1987 kodak had profits of 352 a 
share 
things went about as positive as could have been expected 
eugene glazer an analyst with dean witter reynolds said about 
thursdays meeting considering that virtually everyone went in 
with a negative attitude i think its still negative but not as 
negative 
peter enderlin a stock analyst for smith barney harris upham 
said kodak offered a convincing case for the various cost savings 
and reductions inherent in the sterling deal 
the meeting did not however prompt either analyst to start 
recommending the purchase of kodak stock again kodaks stock edged 
up just 62 cents a share to 42 a share compared to 4912 just 
before the sterling announcement 
kaska who is kodaks chief spokesman said that while the 
recent rash of troubles had kept him busy they were really nothing 
more than temporary setbacks

he said the sterling acquisition will prove over time to be good 
deal the lithium battery shortcoming will be corrected in a few 
weeks the polaroid damage estimate is absurd the phototron 
lawsuit will be thrown out on appeal and the bond rating is not so 
bad 
the company has a bright future period kaska said 
maney said he has been getting many calls from kodak investors 
in rochester who are disturbed by the flurry of bad news but his 
advice to them is to buy more kodak stock

the government will announce by march 4 its 
response to foreign banks secret bids for bonds offered by mexico 
in an innovative plan to reduce its 105 billion in foreign debt 
the treasury department said 
mexicos approximately 560 creditor banks had until 4 pm est 
friday to submit their sealed bids under the plan devised by the 
mexican and us governments 
new yorkbased jp morgan amp co exchange agent for the deal 
refused to disclose details of the bids 
over the next week mexican officials will consider how much 
debt would be cleared and service cost reductions in determining 
whether to accept each bid the treasury department said in a 
statement 
the plan involves exchanging some of the debt mexico owes 
foreign commercial bankers for new 20year bonds to be issued by 
the government 
the bonds backed by 10 billion worth of special us treasury 
securities will carry a higher interest rate than mexico is paying 
on the old debt 
mexicos potential savings will be in proportion to the offers 
that are accepted the department said in a statement carried by 
the government newspaper el nacional 
in addition to the bond scheme the government will present 
other options and programs to its creditors to reduce the 
countrys debt burden the treasury statement added 
it refused to predict how much principal and interest the 
government might save under the bond program saying each bank bid 
must be analyzed first but mexican officials previously have 
warned that if the offers are not attractive enough they may 
reject all of them 
participating banks sought to get as much money as they could 
for their old loans while mexico wants to buy the debt cheaply 
most analysts expected bidders to offer discounts of between 30 
cents and 40 cents to the dollar mexican debt paper sold for 48 
cents to the dollar in early february 
observers doubted the government could market the entire 10 
billion package mexican officials they said would consider at 
least 3 billion in securities sales to be acceptable 
the treasury department said that at the least the mexican bond 
scheme had achieved a formal recognition by mexican creditors 
of the difference between the debts book value and that commanded 
on secondary markets

brussels stock exchange officials 
suspended trading in societe generale de belgique sa for a second 
straight day friday as soaring demand for the stock highlighted 
the intense battle for control over belgiums biggest holding 
company 
societe generale shares opened with offers hitting a record 
8060 francs or 23030 per share up 15 percent over thursday 
on thursday italian investor carlo de benedetti had doubled his 
original offer to 8000 francs or 22860 
de benedetti claims to control 45 percent of societe generale 
stock he wants 7 more percent to counter an alliance of french 
belgian luxembourg and swiss investors which claims it controls 
52 percent of societe generale shares 
de benedetti disputes that claim 
societe generale management which supports the alliance denied 
reports of a rift within the group on friday 
there are accords between different partners to be sure this 
majority exists said etienne davignon a societe generale 
director 
the italian financier has said he wanted to expand societe 
generales holdings throughout europe by 1992 when the european 
economic community expects to have removed all internal bariers to 
trade among the 12 eec nations 
the alliance opposing de benedetti wants the 166yearold 
company to remain anchored in belgium 
trading in societe generale was first halted thursday after the 
share price rose to a record 7010 francs or 200 shortly after 
the stock exchange opened 
the stock closed at 6100 francs or 17429 wednesday and at 
5350 francs or 15286 tuesday it stood at 2155 francs or 
6158 last october when hints of the looming takeover battle 
began to appear 
on friday a new freeze forced any trading in the share off the 
exchange to the unofficial market 
this market has accounted for millions of transactions on given 
days over the course of the last few months but has largely dried 
up in recent days to the lack of available shares 
we had offers as high as 10000 francs or 285 per share but 
had no paper for them said one dealer at a major brokerage firm 
the alliance battling de benedetti is formed around the french 
firms compagnie financiere de suez an investment firm compagnie 
generale delectricite an industrial company and societe 
financiere et industrielle gaz et eaux 
together they control 36 percent while an international group 
around belgiums biggest insurance company groupe ag controls 
another 16 percent 
the 166yearold societe generale has interests in some 1400 
firms worldwide and in about half of belgiums top 50 companies

arthur emil never envisioned traveling all the 
way to japan to sell some of the 54 luxury condominiums he 
developed in lower manhattan 
and he was more than a little skeptical when japans fujisankei 
communications group approached him about featuring one of the 
units on a homeshopping broadcast that would air in tokyo osaka 
and nine other cities in late january 
a fujisankei representative explained that the communications 
giants satellite shopping network markets highticket items 
emil said they said they sold a chateau in france 
and what could be more highclass than his condos which range 
in price from 500000 to 17 million and feature such amenities 
as commercialstyle refrigerators in the gourmet kitchens 17foot 
ceilings and a 24hour concierge in addition to the doorman 
emil had a hard time with the notion that someone would buy an 
apartment without physically visiting the property although he 
said it does happen from time to time 
but fujisankei promised after a single broadcast to present 
him with 20 to 25 qualified buyers im assuming these are real 
buyers he said shortly before leaving for japan in early 
february 
but 16000 miles later and one week later emil was a believer 
you can sell apartments in the united states by television in 
japan he exclaimed 
while emil said fujisankei introduced him to fewer qualified 
buyers than promised he was still pleased 
none of the investors signed on the dotted line but emil said 
several are coming to new york to see the landmark building in the 
near future and hes confident hell close on more than one deal 
emil described the buyers as wealthy executives who do business 
in and around new york and were attracted by the buildings luxury 
qualities 
i expected a number of offshore buyers but that i would 
schlep myself over to japan he joked 
fujisankeis january broadcast proved to be successful not only 
for emil a limousine used by pope john xxiii also sold to an 
unnamed bidder for 423000

in a courtroom filled with 100 lawyers a 
bankruptcy judge on friday began trying to sort out how to handle 
the complex historic public service company of new hampshire 
reorganization 
judge james yacos reached no immediate decision on a 
procedural mechanism for the case after a 2hour hearing but 
he approved several preliminary motions including the utilitys 
request to retain a law firm to consider a us supreme court 
challenge of a state law that bars advance charges for power plants 
public service choked by debt from its 21 billion investment 
in the stalled seabrook nuclear power plant sought refuge from 
creditors in bankruptcy court on jan 28 two days earlier the 
state supreme court upheld the state law that bars the utility from 
charging ratepayers for seabrook unless the reactor surmounts 
evacuationplanning hurdles and wins a commercial license 
new hampshires largest power company with 360000 customers 
became the first major investorowned utility to seek protection 
from its creditors since the depression 
yacos noted that congress did not contemplate the insolvency of 
an electric utility with captive customers when it drafted the 
bankruptcy law 
this case wasnt supposed to happen yacos said because 
there had been a belief that utility regulators would save troubled 
companies but the state court ruling denied public service an 
emergency rate increase 
we are doing what congress didnt do and if we can do it in a 
year which i hope we can do it would be a miracle yacos said 
public service has 120 days from its bankruptcy filing to 
present a reorganization plan other parties then could propose 
rival plans though debtors often get lengthy extensions of the 
exclusivity period yacos said he is inclined not to grant one 
to public service

sales of existing homes suffered their third 
consecutive monthly decline in january a 36 percent drop which 
pushed activity to its slowest level in 2 years a real estate 
trade group said friday 
the national association of realtors said that sales of existing 
singlefamily homes dropped to a seasnally adjusted annual rate of 
321 million units last month following declines of 12 percent in 
december and 29 percent in november the association said that 
consumer fears raised by the collapse of the stock market in 
october were partly to blame for the slowdown 
the sales decline was accompanied by an increase in home prices 
which rose 2500 to a median price of 87900 in january up 6 
percent from a year ago 
the decline in sales pushed the annual sales rate the number of 
homes that would be sold if the monthly sales pace continued for a 
year to its lowest level since june 1985 
john tuccillo the realtors chief economist said he did not 
believe the downturn in housing would be permanent or would lead to 
a recession 
anecdotal evidence suggests that sales in february were more 
brisk than in january he said crediting lower mortgage rates 
and better economic news for the rebound 
the federal home loan mortgage corp reported friday that its 
nationwide survey found 30year mortgages had dipped to 987 
percent this week down from 992 percent the previous week the 
new rate is almost a full percentage point below where it was at 
the beginning of the year 
sales were off in every region of the country in january except 
the midwest which posted a 45 percent gain to an annual rate of 
920000 units 
sales dropped 122 percent in the west to a rate of 500000 
units and fell 96 percent in the south to a rate of 112 million 
units sales fell 47 percent in the northeast to 610000 units a 
decline blamed in part on job layoffs in the new york financial 
district following the market crash 
but the northeast continued to report the fastest jump in home 
prices a 14 percent gain over the past 12 months to a median price 
of 135000 
the west was close behind with a 122 percent rise in home 
prices over the past year pushing the median sales price to 
116000 the south where sales have been depressed by weakness in 
energy and farming saw prices rise 37 percent to 82000 in the 
midwest home prices rose 3 percent to 67400

cocoa futures prices dropped sharply friday amid fears that a 
london trading house was preparing to release an estimate showing a 
jump in surplus production 
in other markets energy futures prices were mostly lower 
precious metals retreated soybean prices rallied while grains were 
mixed cattle and pork prices also were mixed 
a wave of selling in the cocoa pit at new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange was triggered by rumors that londonbased gill and 
duffus is preparing a report showing a production surplus of 
130000 to 140000 tons for the 198788 crop year ending in august 
analysts said 
that compares to the most recent estimate of world production 
of 93000 tons surplus from the international cocoa organization 
said debra tropp an analyst with philipp brothers inc in new york 
this is a substantial increase she said even if you take 
into account recent rumors that ivory coast production might be up 
this still exceeds most market expectations 
cocoa prices settled 39 to 45 lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 1609 a ton 
energy futures prices continued a downward swing in quiet 
trading at the new york mercantile exchange 
crude oil futures prices settled unchanged to 14 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in february at 1536 a barrel 
heating oil prices were 48 cent higher to 18 cent lower with 
february at 4547 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline settled 11 
cent to 45 cent lower with march at 4526 cents a gallon 
the drop in energy futures prices helped drag down precious 
metals prices which began a retreat earlier this week in trading 
at the new york commodity exchange said bette raptopoulos an 
analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
a sharp decline in the commodity index a measure of inflation 
added pressure but the negative market was tempered by political 
turmoil that has resurfaced in south africa and a softer us 
dollar she said 
gold prices settled 360 to 460 lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 42960 a troy ounce and silver prices 
settled 9 cents lower across the board with the march contract at 
6155 cents a troy ounce 
a wave of buying by big professional traders sparked a rally in 
the soybean pit and also helped support corn prices in trading on 
the chicago board of trade 
cattle and pork futures prices were mixed at the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
live cattle prices settled 10 cent to 15 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in april at 7255 cents a pound feeder 
cattle settled 2 cent lower to 10 cent higher with march at 
8072 cents a pound hogs were 45 cent lower to 30 higher with 
april at 4430 cents a pound and pork bellies settled unchanged to 
47 cent lower with march at 5210 cents a pound 
soybean futures prices advanced while grains were mixed at the 
chicago board of trade 
concerns over rains in brazils soybean region subsided as the 
session got under way and traders discounted that as a negative 
factor said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
technical rather than outside factors had the biggest influence 
over the markets he said 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 315 a bushel corn settled cent to 2 
cents higher with march at 200 a bushel oats settled cent 
lower to 1 cent higher with march at 190 a bushel and soybeans

the champion spark plug co announced friday 
that nearly 20 percent of its 1700 production workers nationwide 
will be laid off because of overcapacity in the auto parts industry 
the bulk of the cuts which will begin march 22 and will be 
phased in over the next four months are being made at the plant 
here 
the layoffs come just one month after workers at four us 
champion plants approved a new fouryear contract that includes a 
provision that the company try to increase production at two of its 
domestic plants 
we explored every alternative to reducing the labor force 
even though the numbers are regrettable it was the only way we 
could keep a significant number of manufacturing presence in 
toledo said william walker champions industrial relations 
director 
there is clearly too much capacity in the auto parts industry 
and we have elected to balance production rather than close and 
consolidate plants he said 
a total of 243 toledo workers 119 people from the aviation 
products group and 124 from automotive operations will lose their 
jobs the company said champion currently employs about 800 
production workers in toledo 
an additional 63 people will be laid off at the companys three 
other us manufacturing facilities including 13 at the detroit 
20 at cambridge ohio and 30 at burlington iowa 
walker said uaw leaders were aware of the overcapacity situation 
when they agreed to a new national contract last month which 
covers about 1700 workers at the us champion plants 
we informed them of the possible consequences to champion 
specifically that about 200 workers might be laid off in the 
coming months as a result it was a recognized fact in the 
negotiations and led to a major effort on the part of the company 
and the uaw to assure those who were laid off that they would 
receive benefits walker said 
rodney smith international representative for the uaw said he 
was disappointed with champions decision 
its bad news for us thats for sure he said 
walker said the effect of the toledo layoffs could be lessened 
by normal attrition through the retirement of 60 to 70 production 
workers 
he also said the company is reducing its toledo aviation 
division because it is trying to balance production between toledo 
and liberty sc a nonunion plant

bond prices rose in thin trading friday 
supported partly by indications of continued moderate inflation 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond rose by nearly 
point or 750 per 1000 in face value with its yield declining 
to 836 percent from 842 percent late thursday 
analysts said that after a busy morning session market activity 
quieted for the rest of the day with price movements occurring in 
very thin trading 
helping to tug prices higher was the labor department report 
that its consumer price index rose 03 percent in january a pace 
generally expected by the market analysts said the monthly rate 
translated into a moderate 42 percent annual rate compared with 
44 percent in 1987 
high inflation erodes returns on fixedincome securities such as 
bonds and reduces their attractiveness as investments 
in addition to the cpi report the commodity research bureau 
futures index of 21 commodities fell a sharp 142 to 22426 many 
market participants consider the index a reflection of inflationary 
expectations with a decline thought to signal lower nearterm 
inflation 
furthering such sentiments were additional declines in crude oil 
prices the april contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude fell 14 cents to 1578 per 42gallon barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange its lowest since late december 
otherwise analysts said many market participants were limiting 
their activity in the absence of major new economic news many are 
waiting for next fridays us unemployment report for february 
before taking major investment positions 
the economy still seems to be moving at a decent clip and no 
one has any strong convictions in either direction to buy or sell 
so the market waffles in a narrow trading range said elizabeth 
reiners a vice president of money market research at dean witter 
reynolds inc 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose point intermediate maturities rose in the range 
of 316 point to 1532 point and 20year issues rose point 
according to the investment firm salomon brothers inc 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer rose 032 to 11371 the shearson lehman daily 
treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement rose 346 
to 118935 
in corporate trading industrials rose point and utilities 
rose point according to salomon brothers trading was light 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer rose 009 to 28457 
among taxexempt municipal bonds general obligations and dollar 
bonds were unchanged in light trading 
yields on threemonth treasury bills were down 4 basis points to 
559 percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
sixmonth bills fell 3 basis points to 576 percent and oneyear 
bills were off 4 basis points to 619 percent 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at 6 916 percent unchanged from late thursday

the federal communications commission signaled 
a tougher stance thursday on minority hiring putting conditions on 
license renewals of 11 southern television stations with 
affirmative action efforts it found defective 
the action the first since the fcc revised its equal employment 
opportunity guidelines last year shows that we mean business 
said commissioner patricia diaz dennis 
the fcc renewed the stations licenses but said they must report 
periodically to the agency on efforts to recruit hire and promote 
qualified women and minorities 
the commission will monitor the stations efforts and if 
unsatisfied could conduct an investigation if the fcc still is 
unsatisfied with a stations equal employment opportunity efforts 
it could take steps to revoke the stations license 
the national black media coalition had asked the fcc to deny 
license renewals to 19 tv stations because of what the group called 
deficient affirmative action efforts 
pluria marshall coalition chairman said that while he was 
disappointed the commission did not take stronger action it was 
a step in the right direction 
the fcc requires all tv and radio stations to have plans 
describing their efforts to find hire and promote qualified women 
blacks and other minorities the plans are reviewed at the time of 
license renewal every five years for tv stations and every seven 
for radio stations 
in revising its equal employment opportunity guidelines last 
year the fcc required more detailed reporting by stations and put 
stronger emphasis on evaluation of a stations overall employment 
efforts rather than focusing on the the number of minorities and 
women employed 
with the revision the fcc also decided to scrutinize all plans 
previously the agency looked closely at plans of stations where 
minority employment was less than 50 percent of the minority 
population of the work force in the stations area 
one of the stations cited wtwctv in tallahassee fla had 
more minority employees than required by the fcc parity guidelines 
but the commission said merely meeting or exceeding these 
guidelines is not a safe harbor 
the number of minorities and women that a station employs is 
important and continues to be a factor which we consider said 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick 
we will not use numbers as a strict quota below which a 
broadcaster will necessarily fail in their eeo program if they are 
making aggressive and adequate efforts to correct the problem he 
said but nor will numbers be used as a safe harbor above which 
broadcasters will necessarily be found to be in compliance 
the simple lesson is that all broadcasters must have in place 
an affirmative action program which puts them in a position to 
identify and recruit and retain qualified minorities and women 
he said 
besides wtwc the stations required to submit further reports to 
the fcc are wncttv greenville nc wunctv chapel hill nc 
wtkktv manassas va wtgltv cocoa fla wxeltv west palm 
beach fla wnfttv jacksonville fla ketstv little rock 
ark wlpbtv baton rouge la wyestv new orleans la and 
wjtctv pensacola fla 
all stations in a block of states come up for renewal in the 
same year

after a month of public discord campeau corp 
and federated department stores inc announced friday they had 
opened negotiations on a 61 billion merger agreement 
federateds board of directors which met in regular session 
thursday authorized the merger talks in which campeau proposes to 
pay 68 in cash for each share of federated 
the proposal which followed campeaus pledge to sell off its 
brooks brothers division to help finance the merger is to be 
presented to the federated board monday the companies said in 
their joint announcement 
no assurance can be given that a definitive agreement will be 
reached the companies said 
it was the first sign of a softening in campeaus monthlong 
increasingly hostile campaign to buy federated the 
cincinnatibased federated had 11 billion in sales last year the 
torontobased campeau a development company bought allied stores 
corp in december 1986 
sixtyeight dollars per share is a good price the 
shareholders should be happy said monroe h greenstein an 
analyst with the bear stearns firm in new york city 
federated stock rose 150 to 6450 a share in late new york 
stock exchange trading friday 
the merger proposal is separate from campeaus latest hostile 
takeover offer its 66pershare tender bid made thursday campeau 
spokeswoman joele frank said friday in new york city that offer 
was improved from a previous 61pershare proposal 
federated has 904 million common shares and equivalents 
outstanding in addition to acquiring the companys 885 million 
outstanding shares campeau would pay about 100 million to buy up 
outstanding federated stock options 
whats new about this is that negotiations are under way and 
that the price has been agreed on ms frank said 
greenstein predicted that campeau corp would if it buys 
federated sell off some federated holdings including 
nondepartment store assets and underperforming department store 
groups 
greenstein said those groups might include i magnin in san 
francisco lazarus in cincinnati and abraham amp straus in new york 
all these have been known to be underperformers in recent 
years he said 
thursday the canadian company increased its tender offer to 
federated from 61 to 66 per share and said it would consider 
making a higher bid if necessary campeau has been bidding to buy 
federated since jan 25 
federateds board said friday it has deferred until 1159 pm 
est monday implementation of a poison pill shareholder rights 
measure designed to make a takeover of federated more difficult 
the board said it could later decide to further delay the measures 
implementation 
federated has rejected previous campeau takeover bids 
questioning whether campeau had obtained the necessary financing 
campeau chairman robert campeau says he has the financing and would 
be willing to match offers by other bidders for federated 
campeau said thursday it would raise a substantial amount of 
equity for its proposed buyout by selling the brooks brothers 
division of its allied stores corp unit to britains marks and 
spencer plc for 770 million the brooks brothers sale was 
conditioned on campeau acquiring federated 
the brooks brothers sale also could preempt antitrust concerns 
raised by sen howard metzenbaum dohio in connection with the 
proposed federated acquisition metzenbaum is concerned that a 
campeau purchase of federated could hurt competition in some us 
markets such as new york and miami where both allied and 
federated operate stores 
federateds board has previously rejected offers of 66 and 47 
per share the company has been considering alternatives such as 
selling some of its nondepartment store assets or having 
management buy the company and convert it to private ownership 
federated operates 650 stores nationwide its holdings include 
the new york chains bloomingdales and abraham and straus filenes 
of boston burdines of miami richs in atlanta bullocks and 
bullocks wilshire in los angeles i magnin in san francisco and

of stop amp shop cos inc in its 103 billion hostile takeover bid 
for the supermarket chain

submitted to stop amp shop applications from holders of more than 10 
percent of stop amp shops outstanding shares calling for a special 
shareholders meeting on march 30 according to dart spokesman 
stanley rubenstein

massachusetts business corporation law is to consider replacing 
stop amp shops board with jeffersons nominees and adopting related 
resolutions 
stop amp shop spokeswoman aileen gorman declined to comment on 
darts latest announcement 
stop amp shop based in braintree mass on feb 12 filed a 
federal suit to block darts 37ashare offer stop amp shop claimed 
that dart failed to register as an investment company with the 
federal securities and exchange commission and failed to disclose 
details of its past takeover attempts 
dart responded with a countersuit claiming that stop amp shop 
illegally withheld corporate information us district judge rya 
zobel ruled dart must file its claim in norfolk superior court in 
massachusetts

marks and spencer plc where prime minister 
margaret thatcher shops is poised to establish a major us 
beachhead with its planned purchase of the preppy clothier brooks 
brothers 
marks and sparks as the 550store chain is affectionately 
known among rhymeloving londoners has been seeking to expand in 
the united states for more than a year as part of its strategy of 
becoming a global retailer 
marks and spencer announced thursday it had agreed in principle 
to buy brooks brothers for 770 million from campeau corp the 
canadian retailing and real estate company if campeau acquired 
federated department stores inc of cincinnati 
campeau and federated disclosed friday they were negotiating a 
61 billion merger but said there was no guarantee they would 
reach a definitive merger agreement federated already has rejected 
several lower offers from campeau 
marks and spencer has grown in 104 years from a market stall to 
a favorite store of the average briton its also where mrs 
thatcher buys her underwear because she says it is well made 
the retailer hopes to get brooks brothers flagship store on new 
york citys madison avenue its 46 other us stores and 12 
jointventure outlets in japan 
british retailers have boomed in recent years on strong spending 
by consumers and their increased use of credit this has prompted 
some retailers to ponder expansion outside britain which they now 
see as too small a market 
marks and spencer needs to become a global retailer and to a 
certain extent hey do need to get into the us market to fulfill 
that ambition said charles allen an industry consultant with 
the investment firm wood mackenzie and co 
other british retailers that have expanded into the united 
states by acquisition or opening of new stores include storehouse 
plc owner of the conrans home furnishing stores dixons group 
plc owner of the silo electric appliance chain and the jeweler 
ratners plc 
but reaction to marks and spencers plans were mixed in the 
city londons financial district 
marks and spencer fell 45 pence about 8 cents at current 
exchange rtes to 176 pence or 312 a share late friday on the 
london stock exchange after falling the same amount on thursday 
analysts agreed the retailer should target the united states but 
were divided about whether the acquisition of brooks brothers was 
the right choice and whether marks and spencer agreed to pay too 
high a price 
some also expressed concern that marks and spencer was 
establishing its beachhead in a portion of the us market that 
might be softening 
wood mackenzies allen said the company agreed too quickly to 
something that wasnt a sure deal 
marks and spencers pretax profit growth will slow to 5 percent 
from 10 percent in its new fiscal year beginning april 3 because of 
the acquisition allen predicted 
but paul backhouse a retail analyst with the investment firm 
morgan grenfell and co said this is a longterm move for marks 
and spencer 
analysts also noted that although many foreigners view the us 
market as uniform it has regional differences that make marketing 
products challenging 
marks and spencer stated thursday the acquisition of brooks 
brothers would represent a substantial opportunity for marks and 
spencer to enter the us retail clothing market through a major 
longestablished business with a high reputation for quality 
marks and spencer said it wants to use its retailing expertise 
to boost brooks brothers business 
brooks brothers and marks and spencer are similar in that they 
both sell durable quality merchandise under their own brand name 
and they stick with classic designs 
but there are some big differences brooks brothers caters to a 
small clientele of the welltodo marks and spencer markets huge 
volumes to the middle class 
marks and spencer also sells more than clothes it sells food 
under its st michael brand name and home furnishings 
marks and spencer ventured into the us market last year by 
opening four womens clothing stores in upstate new york under the 
name dallairds 
a marks and spencer spokeswoman who did not want to be named 
declined to detail how the stores were faring but said the company 
remained optimistic about their prospects 
marks and spencer has had mixed results with its efforts to 
expand into other foreign countries 
profits for its 11 stores in the rest of europe jumped 25 
percent in its most recent fiscal year but in canada where it 
operates 260 stores its profit sank 61 percent 
the company plans to open a store under its own name in hong 
kong in may 
marks and spencers pretax profit jumped 18 percent to 432 
million pounds about 765 million in the year ended march 1987 on 
a 135 percent revenue gain to 42 billion pounds 74 billion
